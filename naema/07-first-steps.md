Naema was tired of always being wary of Hedala, of watching her out the corner
of her eye all the time, of being on the receiving end of similar distrust. She
was literally tired of trying to stay awake until the younger girl went to
sleep, ear straining so she could listen to any odd noises, blaster on hand.

She was weary of double-checking everything that was proposed, and weary of the
anxiety that came from not being able to decide off the knowledge she had,
because Hedala was good at what she did, good at research, good at figuring out
tradeoffs. She could be, too, but slower, and she didn't nearly have the time.

They were both adults, damn it!

So she sat down for breakfast one morning, cleared away the foodstuffs, looked a
surprised and cautious Hedala in the eyes, and explained.

"We've got to trust each other at least the bare minimum. Look. I'm not going to
leave you behind. I gave my word, and also you're useful."

The girl stared a bit, hunched over, then let out a tight breath in saccades.
When she peeked back up, she had a hint of a smile, timid.

Hedala placed her hands flat on the table, remembering the traditions her Uncle
had taught her, and bowed slightly.

"I give my word as myself and as Fardi, that I will not betray you, that I will
not leave without telling you, and that I will not harm you without
provocation."

She straightened, and smiled a little more.

Naema answered with a nod, then stuck a hand out across the table.

"To aâ€¦ business partnership."

Hedala blinked, but took her hand, and repeated the words.

They had struck a deal.

From then on, things went a lot smoother.




[][As they get familiar with the ship and the vendors at their current stop,
they express to each other the impending need to take on work. Hedala admits
that she has little experience in the matter, even if yes, her Clan was a
smuggling Clan. They calculate their costs, then formulate a minimum price, and
agree to double it when starting negotiations, and to never go below half of
that. Hedala does all calculations in her head, to Naema's astonishment.]
