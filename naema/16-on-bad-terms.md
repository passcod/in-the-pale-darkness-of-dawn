Hedala saw a figure through the windows, and stood up, and ran out of the door.
Naema blinked and sat still a moment, before realising and going after her. The
figure, surprised, turned around and winced and Naema felt her face harden just
before her companion's shout:

"Thabeska is not free, Leia!"

"I know, I _know_, but it's a beginning, we needed peace--"

"The Republic," Hedala sneered, "is at peace. Our _home_ is not."

Leia looked genuinely taken aback at the venomous tone, before tightening her
features in the mask of politics. She was no longer their General, Naema
thought, and she felt tired, suddenly, then stepped away even as Leia argued in
favour of the Republic.

"Come on," she told Hedala, interrupting them both, "we've got work to do."

Hedala glared, before turning her back without a goodbye, and stomping back
through to the mess. Naema looked at Leia for a long moment, then said:

"We believe in the republic, Organa. We fought for it. Just-- not yours."
