Neither had wanted to fall asleep before the other, or at all. They had talked,
they had agreed, but both felt it was too early for trust, and they could still
leave the other in a shuttle and carry the same plan out one girl down. The
issue would be subduing the other, which would be much easier if that one was
asleep. But that was only a technical issue: the real problem with that thought
was how they felt about it.

Naema held an ingrained respect for the Fardi, passed from her parents and
culture, even though that warred with her distrust and disregard of authority
borne from years living under the Empire. She also trusted people from her own
planet marginally more than anyone else. More importantly, though, while she
was aware that honour and fairness were sometimes (_most of the time, in this
wider wilder world_, she reminded herself) not… beneficial when dealing with
others, with beings who would not hold themselves to such a standard, or who
would exploit her own, even, if given the chance… she wished to hold _herself_
to a higher standard. She would keep her word.

That did not mean Hedala would, though.

Hedala, however, knew she was and looked too young. ‘Kid’ indeed. She’d never
be able to carry out her escape if she didn’t have the older girl’s help. Even
if she did manage, she had little hope of surviving or remaining free without
help. Two girls traveling alone, without anyone looking out for them, nor any
overt affiliations to clan or Family, was already going to be a juicy target
for traffickers and slavers. A single young girl? that was madness. She needed
Naema. Naema, however, didn’t need her.

In the end, fatigue won out. Hedala was younger and not used to sleepless
nights, and she knew this. With fear of betrayal gripping her heart, trying to
stay silent so she'd hear better, watching, waiting for any movement that could
indicate someone coming, she did not notice when she fell asleep. Ironically,
Naema had already been slumbering for hours when she did.

They both awoke when the navigation computer insistently beeped at them,
announcing imminent hyperspace exit and their arrival to Rinn.

"Hnnnnh," said Hedala, very eloquently. "Five more minutes!" she yelled out.

In her cabin, Naema wished she could agree, but was more used to waking up
early in the morning, and was somewhat more alert and awake. She walked out to
the fresher and splashed some water on her face to properly wake up. Then she
registered what the beeping must mean.

"Aaaah! We're there! Gotta prepare!" she whirled onto the piloting deck, stepped
into the cockpit and, apprehensive, sat and took heed of the many dashboards,
switches, sticks.

There _was_ a difference between a simulator and reality, but thankfully not in
terms of what was in front of her.

‘Okay, breathe. You can do this.’

If she couldn't, they were thoroughly kriffed anyway, but she tried putting that
thought out of her head.

First things first: she squashed the alarm, re-establishing calm, and flicked
through the messages from the ship's navigation AI: they were just under ten
minutes from the optimal hyperspace exit point, relativistic sensors indicated
a three millidegree deviation against the ship's internal map and clock, which
was within normal bounds, and here were the details for the holding orbit they'd
need to insert themselves in upon arrival, for procesing by flight control.

Naema discarded that last message — they wouldn't land nor stay very long — and
checked other indicators, disabling anything they wouldn't need for the time
being. She brought up the countdown to optimal hyperspace exit up on the central
dashboard, disengaged herself from the seat (more comfortable than she'd
thought! and certainly more than the rickety one in the sim), and stepped out.

Hedala was waiting, looking… anxious? wary? she couldn't tell.

"Hey, I had a look at the sensor data for the escape pods, and the crew is still
unconscious in there."

_Okay?_ So what, Naema thought. That was normal, given the dose… Ah.

"Oh, I. Um. Yeah, sorry, should have told you: given the dose they inhaled, they
should all wake up in —" she checked the chrono on the wall and frowned as she
did the calculation. "— about three hours or so."

The girl seemed to relax slightly, at that.

"There's no side effects?" she asked.

"Besides the injuries they got when they fell…" and Hedala was looking somewhat
guilty at that, but Naema just put it down to betraying people who probably had
been charged with protecting her. She really hoped they wouldn't be punished too
harshly for ‘losing’ Hedala, but she decided she couldn't care too hard about
that right now.

"…not really, no. They'll be hungry, because they won't have had food for a long
time, and thirsty, too. But apart from that, I don't think the effects will be
from the gas."

The girl stared for a moment before it dawned on her what Naema was talking
about, and she grimaced.

"Ah, yes. Well, they'll be… physically at least, they'll be fine, I suppose."

"Yeah." Naema watched her for a moment, trying to think of something more to
say, before turning back and shrugging back into the cockpit.

Just before sitting down, she called: "Sit down and strap yourself in! We're
nearly there."

She counted down the seconds along with the chrono display, steeled herself,
then forced herself to relax before taking hold of the wheel. ‘Not a wheel.’
she reminded herself. ‘It looks like a wheel, shut up and _drive_.’ her self
responded.

On the last second of the countdown, she pulled the hyperdrive lever down to
zero, and held her breath as the stars slowed and a white and blue ball appeared
in the viewport, surrounded by pinpricks of light and a much brighter one off to
the side. _Rinn_.

Naema took a moment to appreciate where she was, where she _actually_ was, not
in a sim, but in real space, approaching a different planet from the one she’d
lived on forever.

She had grown up with the knowledge that interplanetary travel was common, but
her first time faced with the evidence, she was still floored by the wonder.

Then she shook herself, and flicked the sublights on, pushing them towards this
new world they wouldn’t even really discover. She felt a tinge of disappointment
at that.

She set the autopilot on, then stepped out back again to see how Hedala was
doing, and do the final preparations prior to their arrivals. She also told the
computer to perform a scan of the planet as they would come up in range, and
identify somewhere that was on land, not inhabited, but close enough to a
population center that a tired group of five humans, a Togruta, and a
Dathomirian could reach it on foot (if necessary).

“It’s only been fifteen minutes,” answered Hedala after being asked how she was.

Naema blinked, staring at the chrono, which said exactly that. It had felt a lot
longer.

“Huh. Well, computer says we’ll be close enough to get to low orbit in about
five. We should have the Galactic charts up and accurate now, so if you want to
pick the system we’re going to next…”

Hadala smiled, and explained she had already been researching that: “We’ll want
a place that can give us banking facilities with no questions asked, and
probably also a spaceport that we can use to put down and change the ship’s
ident and scrape the name off. There’s a few that would do…”

In the end, they picked _Kubindi_, a nearby financial safe-haven (so banking
would not be a problem) that was on a trade route (so starship facilities would
be available), sufficiently close from their current position (so the travel
would be easy) and not actually inside Hutt Space (for rather obvious reasons).

It _had_ been the first place Hedala had presented, but Naema had wanted to
know everything about every choice, so she could be sure of the choice by
herself, and not just rely on the younger girl she didn't yet trust. ‘Yet?’ she
caught herself thinking. ‘Correction: I don’t even know if I should trust her
at all, ever.’

She'd stepped back to her place, kept on eye on their progress towards low
orbit, and flicked through the scan results. Two locations looked promising,
so she picked one at random, then got to work punching _Kubindi_'s coordinates
in the hyperspace navigator so it could get a start on calculating the route.

She checked the fuel cell levels again, a healthy 55%, not enough for a
Galaxy-spanning jump, but enough for, in her estimation, a jump to the Core and
three or four short jumps similar to the one they'd just come out of.

She'd have to calibrate her estimations as they traveled, or get an astromech
droid that could do that for her, but she didn't think that would be anywhere
near the foreseeable future, even with the unexpected windfall from looting the
crew's pockets.

The navicomp beeped again: they were getting within range of the drop-off point.
Naema fingered her straps, then gripped the yoke, eased the repulsors, and
increased the sublights, absent-mindedly flicking on the ‘landing’ crew
indicator, letting _Rinn_'s gravity pull them down to the surface.

Her simulator didn't have _Rinn_ in its memory banks, but it did have _Hoth_,
and they looked very similar, even though _Hoth_ had more green — forests — on
its surface. As far as she could see, _Rinn_ was just ice, unless the local
flora had a pale or clear colouring instead.

They wouldn't be making a landing, so the flora or terrain didn't matter, but
the approach to a highly reflective surface and the atmosphere behaviour for the
cold climate did. She flicked on the shields at full strength automatically
because that was how you had to do it on _Hoth_: atmo was very dense very fast…
then she remembered and called out to Hedala for the actual data.

“0.8 standard, whatever that means,” was the yelled response. So, not full
shields. She thanked the girl while doing the adjustment.

When the ship entered atmo, the vibrations surprised her, but systems looked
nominal. No flashing lights. ‘Whoa, this moves much more than the sim.’

“Hey, is this shaking normal?!”

…or not. She looked around frantically, then systematically ran through each
dashboard zone. Repulsors, nope. Air brakes, off. Sublights, good. Dampeners,
off— ah!

“Oops!” She quickly turned them on, and the shaking stopped.

“What do you mean, ‘Oops’?!”

She ignored the indignant Fardi but winced, even though no one could see.

The descent from that point was smooth. At around two kilometres altitude, she
leveled off, did a quick scan to check off her visuals, then set the autopilot
to maintain altitude and bearing at the lowest speed they could without dropping
off. Then she stepped out.

She found Hedala huddled into a seat, clutching a datapad, flimsi scattered all
over the room.

“We're stable, now.” she assured.

“You're a terrible pilot.” Hedala glared.

_Okay, that was a bit harsh._ “Look, I've not had much practice.”

The younger girl rolled her eyes and stood up gingerly, as if testing the truth
of her words.

“We're there, then?”

Yeah. They were there. Last chance to back away.

Naema started to speak, but Hedala headed her off:

“No, I haven't changed my mind. Let's do this.”

She turned and walked away into the ship.

‘Okay then.’

Naema shuffled across the room, picking up the scattered flimsi to tidy up.

The ship shuddered as the escape pods launched. She released a breath and closed
her eyes. No going back. She trembled at the thought of freedom, and at the
thought of making do on her own. ‘Mum, dad. I'm not even sure what you would
think of all that.’ Her parents had lived all their lives on Thabeska, she knew.
‘I'm going to see the stars.’

Half an hour later, fake recordings transmitted, ident chip removed, and safely
out of atmo, the _Epsilon-class_ cargo transport previously known as _Zepirys_
vanished into hyperspace, en route to _Kubindi_.
