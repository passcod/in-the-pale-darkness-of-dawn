    The reason we don't see a super big shock when Alderaan (or Jedha, Scarif)
explodes:

	Luke is untrained, and wouldn't recognise what he's feeling. But more
importantly, he's really powerful. His Force presence is like a supernova
around him, especially as he hasn't started to really shield. It makes him
powerful, sure, but it also shields him from a lot of external Force things.

	Obi-Wan has been in war most of his life and he's been feeling deaths
in the Force for decades, many times in response to his own actions. He
isolated on Tatooine but never really processed his life. He never relaxed his
shields, both because of that, but also to avoid drawing Vader to Tatooine.
Also, at the exact moment it happens, he's right next to Luke, which is both an
attention-drain (standing next to a Force supernova) and he's within Luke's
accidental shield! So he still gets hit, but it's not super-bad for him.

	All around the Galaxy, there's a) trained Dark Force users, b)
untrained, unaware, hiding, Force sensitives, and c) trained non-Dark Force
users (Vos and Tano, plus others from non-Jedi backgrounds).

	An important component of this fic is exploring the reactions of all
these people to Lothal, Jedha, Scarif, Alderaan.

	For Hedala, it knocks her out. For Tano, who's still on Malachor,
trained by the original Sith, it triggers anger and horror, that she has to
work through. For the Late Sith Force shades on Malachor, it's relish and
admiration and drinking the pain. For the Original Sith Force shades on
Malachor, it's resigned sadness and steel. For some trained Darks, it's
drinking the pain in pleasure. For others, it's deep horror and abhor, and a
kick that pushes them to the Grey. For Vos, it's knee-buckling and screaming
into the sky. For some sensitive pilots, they jerk and twitch and blackout and
lose control of their craft. For a sensitive podracer on an underground
circuit, it's a sudden veer off course, clipping a competitor and crashing in
the audience. For many other sensitives it's deep unexplained sadness. Someone
bursts into tears at dinner for no reason. Children go eerily quiet. Toddlers
bawl or just still. A Senator crushes a datapad in their hands.
