"I need a favour," Orrelios said.

Naema nodded and attempted to tell him they'd do anything, before Hedala glared
to remind her of what had happened the _last_ time she'd said that.

"My grandmother needs transport to Lira San."

That didn't sound too bad. Naema expressed so.

"She's currently still on Lasan."

Hedala pursed her lips. Empire world, but not Core, and outside its net. Not
particularly difficult of access. They'd even been there once.

"Okay." she said.

She must have looked perplexed, because Orrelios grinned a little, and added:

"It's not a hard mission. I can't do it, though, not until after this whole
thing is done; I'm needed too much here, you know." He looked both sad and
proud, at that. "It's not a simple mission, though. You'll need to find her, I
don't think she'll have stayed in the same place."

He didn't mention that this 'same place' was probably gone, destroyed by the
Imperials, but they both heard it unsaid anyway. The family of a Rebel, on an
Empire world? She wouldn't be living out in the open. It wasn't a difficult
mission, but it wasn't an easy one either. None going into enemy territory were.

"I'll give you all the information I can. I also have contact information for
friends on Lira San, when you get there. As well as the routes to reach it."

"We've been," said Naema, glancing at Hedala.

"I've got the route we took saved up, but if you've got better ones..."

Orrelios shook his head.

"Nah. You got it from Hera?"

"Syndulla? Not directly from her, but that's the name on the route."

He nodded. "Then you'll be fine."

They exchanged a few more words, and set a time to go over the information on
his grandmother, before going their separate ways. Naema went to the mess, but
Hedala diverted to the hangar to check on the [TK: ship name].
