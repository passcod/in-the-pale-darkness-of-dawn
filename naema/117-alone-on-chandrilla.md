[][TK Hedala and Naema hug after Hedala comes back to Chandrila]

"Do you remember how we met?"

She looked confused.

"You hijacked my ship."

"No, I mean. For the second time. For real. When I sat you down and we started
over afterwards."

"Ah, yes." Hedala smiled. "We were so awkward and hesitant."

"We were."

They shared a fond moment in remembrance, then Naema asked:

"Remember what you told me at the end?"

Hedala frowned, and Naema despaired she wouldn't know, and irrationally, that it
would ruin everything.

"I told you…"

Naema looked up.

"…that if you ever betrayed me I would find a way to haunt you forever and you'd
never be rid of me?"

"Yes! Yeah."

She paused, and Looked at Hedala, her eyes askance and the tilt of her head
deepening as she watched, in that expression of quiet puzzlement she only showed
when she was out of the eye of anyone else, when she didn't have to play the
characters of Prinoe Kan, or Rea Urquial, or even Hedala Fardi of the Alliance.

Naema smiled at all that and more, and asked in a single breath:

"I'll never betray you, but I'd be delighted — I'd _love_ — if you allowed me to
stay by your side for as long as you'll have me."

Hedala looked up, hopeful but not wanting, not daring to hold out too much hope.

"You mean…"

And Naema's heart hurt, suddenly, because maybe she'd misread it all, and maybe
she wasn't— she wasn't— she didn't—

But Hedala wasn't done:

"…you want to be my girlfriend?"

"Um." She was shocked out of her crushing downturn with the simple words. "Yes!
I mean. Only if you want to?"

"Yes you silly poodoo." Hedala reached a hand up, pulled Neama toward her.

"I'd love to."
