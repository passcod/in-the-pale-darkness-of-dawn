A figure in a beige robe is standing in the sand. Their hood is up, and it is
somehow impossible to see underneath, even when it seems like it should be
possible. A soft desert breeze curls around them, brushing sand up and shoring
it up against the figure's unmoving boots. They seem to be waiting for someone.

If one was able to see into their hood, one would see a wizened face with
extremely tired eyes, wary of life and holding on only using their conviction
that they have one last task to accomplish in this world. One might also notice
their lips moving in endless voiceless repetition, as if they were rehearsing or
reminiscing under their breath or narrating their own life in the third person.

Finally, another figure in a dark robe made its way to the first. For a moment,
there was nothing but silence from one, loud breathing from the other, and an
odd whispered litany about the evilness of sand floating along the wind.

The figure in the beige robe spoke up:

"I am

Then he bowed.

The figure in the dark robe inclined their head in acknowledgement, before
starting their own declamation, in a soft sorrowful rasp:

"I am

He bowed.

Slowly, both of them took out their lightsabers and prepared to ignite them.
