They met in a conference room in the ruined Skytop station. There were already five different underground organisations cooperating — with the occasional and inevitable dispute — to get at least the spaceport and main life systems back online. Shields wouldn't be up for another several days at least, if the murmurs of bleary-eyed techs in the improvised mess hall was anything to go by.

They were many, and from many places. A few appearances were unexpected, but everyone had their reasons. Hedala pointed out Ojeda Syndulla, standing grim, her teal skin peaking out from partial white lekku wrappers, the contrast creating make-shift markings in a pattern Naema thought she recognised.

“She's not with Hera,” she whispered. “Must have left them on Ryloth.”

“Ryloth is declaring for the Republic, I think.” answered Hedala.

That explained their absence, with the Syndulla patriarch likely forming a government, and Hera as his heir for the clan. It didn't explain Ojeda, but perhaps…

“Keeping an eye on us or keeping their options open, you think?” she asked idly.

“‘Us’?” Hedala sounded amused. “I didn't think Ojeda cared much for clan politics, but family's family, so it could be.”

_Family._ Naema pursed her lips and changed the subject, towards a contingent of Aqualish and humans she thinks might hail from Cargamalis.

“Anoat and Brunaii both are still split, even though the Concordance—” Hedala's expression twisted at the word. “—afforded them a ceasefire.”

“For the moment.” Naema enjoined.

“A ceasefire helps, but they're looking for something more permanent.” A deep voice sounded behind them, surprising them.

“Zeb!” Naema exclaimed.

Hedala quickly hid the vibroknife she'd instinctively palmed, but Zed's twinkling eyes told her she'd been seen.

“You know better than to sneak on— well, anyone, here.” she grumbled.

“Habits, dear.”

She rolled her eyes. Zeb didn't _have_ habits, that's what made him good.

“What are you doing here?”

He gave a quick smile, eyes sweeping their surroundings briefly. She'd have missed it if she wasn't used to it.

“I'm representing Lira San. Grandma didn't wait around doing nothing. She got herself on the ruling council — don't ask me how, I have _no_ idea—”

“I bet I do.” murmured Naema.

Zeb raised an eyebrow.

“She was very… enthusiastic when we ferried her.” she spoke up.

“Full of good… advice.” added Hedala, with a hint of a smirk.

Zeb looked lost for a moment, then continued.

“Right, well, anyway, Lira San is considering being part of either the Alliance — sorry, Republic — or whatever y'all whip up here.” he gestured, but kept his focus on the duo.

“We didn't really _do_ anything.” Naema defended.

“I beg to disagree.” Another voice, surprising them, another twitch from Hedala, who managed _not_ to take out a weapon this time.

Naema was certain she'd seen the newcomer before, but couldn't think of a name, or even an affiliation. Hedala didn't show signs of recognition, either.

He was average height, for a human, dark skin, dark hair, a crisp beige suit but no jewelry nor insignia that could help. He was wearing a leather sling with hooks and holes for a satchel, blaster, other things perhaps, but none were attached right now. A genial smile that looked genuine that, at the same time, somehow, also looked practiced, graced his features, mustache bending slightly upwards and dark eyes revealing nothing.

_Politician or smuggler?_ she mused, then realised she'd said that out load when he answered, jovial:

“Both and much more, m'lady.”

She almost expected a bow.

“Calrissian.” growled Zeb.

And there it was. Lando Calrissian, bane of Captain Solo (she'd heard enough stories), hero of Endor, and respected General of the Alliance. If that wasn't ominous enough, Zeb apparently disliked him. That could not be anything good.

“What does the New Republic want here?” she asked brusquely.

“The New Republic wants to confirm that nothing interesting is happening here…”

Everyone bristled, and Lando hurried to continue.

“and that's what I'll report. But _I_ am interested in my own capacity. And I have heard… interesting things.”

“Really now.” drawled Hedala.

“Not many people know who _you_ are, but your… altercation with the Princess _is_ commonly talked about. Parroted, even. I have heard the phrase ‘Not our Republic’ no less than a dozen times, and that was _before_ I got in here.”

He'd used the conversation to draw himself a bit closer, and lower his voice, but took a hasty step back at a glare from Garrazeb, who looked slightly less hostile but definitely not friendly.

Zeb huffed and turned away from Calrissian:

“I'm going to get a drink. Don't let him flatter you, and don't make any deals.”

‘_Definitely_ a history there,’ thought Hedala. ‘We'll have to ask later.’

[][TK Hedala and Naema hug after Hedala comes back to Chandrila]

"Do you remember how we met?"

She looked confused.

"You hijacked my ship."

"No, I mean. For the second time. For real. When I sat you down and we started
over afterwards."

"Ah, yes." Hedala smiled. "We were so awkward and hesitant."

"We were."

They shared a fond moment in remembrance, then Naema asked:

"Remember what you told me at the end?"

Hedala frowned, and Naema despaired she wouldn't know, and irrationally, that it
would ruin everything.

"I told you…"

Naema looked up.

"…that if you ever betrayed me I would find a way to haunt you forever and you'd
never be rid of me?"

"Yes! Yeah."

She paused, and Looked at Hedala, her eyes askance and the tilt of her head
deepening as she watched, in that expression of quiet puzzlement she only showed
when she was out of the eye of anyone else, when she didn't have to play the
characters of Prinoe Kan, or Rea Urquial, or even Hedala Fardi of the Alliance.

Naema smiled at all that and more, and asked in a single breath:

"I'll never betray you, but I'd be delighted — I'd _love_ — if you allowed me to
stay by your side for as long as you'll have me."

Hedala looked up, hopeful but not wanting, not daring to hold out too much hope.

"You mean…"

And Naema's heart hurt, suddenly, because maybe she'd misread it all, and maybe
she wasn't— she wasn't— she didn't—

But Hedala wasn't done:

"…you want to be my girlfriend?"

"Um." She was shocked out of her crushing downturn with the simple words. "Yes!
I mean. Only if you want to?"

"Yes you silly poodoo." Hedala reached a hand up, pulled Neama toward her.

"I'd love to."
