Jeira gets married days before the first Imperial officer steps off his shuttle
and takes over governance of Thabeska. She was strongly advised to do so during
a Holonet conversation with Bren, who heard from Higor, who was directed to
relay the message by a Fardi. So it's solid info.

The Empire is coming. The Empire has already claimed Thabeska as its own, merely
days after the attempt on the Supreme Chancelor and the Jedi massacre and the
disbanding of the Republic.

The Empire is days old and already known for not being particularly kind to
anything that deviates from its model of what beings should look like and behave
like. Beings should look human; beings should obey.

Thabeska, in a way, is lucky: it has no native population and is 90% humanoid.
It is also sufficiently far into the Outer Rim that a certain level of
lawlessness will be tolerated. It also has a strong and old history under a
hybrid democratic and autocratic model. It's a small planet with little in the
way of valuable exports or resources; it's not even on a traderoute!

The marriage frenzy is an administrative precaution, to create a paper proof
and bureaucracy-recognised guarantee. Families on Thabeska are historically
documented only internally, with the _fardishùma_, the family record, kept by
each line and branch. Only families that travelled to worlds where Galactic
marriages matterred more had theirs done; it had been on the Santi's todolist
for some years now, but they had never really needed it.

The ‘official’ marriage won’t change anything: Jeira has been living with Beca
for more than ten years. They moved in together rather precipitously when Beca
got pregnant, but that was a long time ago now.

It doesn't help calm Jeira's nerves. She wishes they could have done this
properly. She frets as she tells Beca, but softens at their easy smile and
embraces them for reassurance.

"It'll be alright," they soothe. "We'll go tomorrow while Naema is at school."

It takes more time to get to the townhall and back than to go through the entire
process, even accounting for queuing. It's early yet in the morning, just before
ninth hour, and according to the flimsi they're given as they wait, they're the
47th family of the day.

Jeira calms a toddler for family number 53 as the father calms his partner,
trying not to let her own anxiety show through, when they're called on. Names
and ident chips are checked by a droid, their religious preference enquired on.
(No requirements for either of them; Jeira knows Beca's family subscribes to a
small Temple on their home planet, but they haven't visited in years.) Too fast,
they're guided to a chamber where a volunteering Fardi is waiting, looking
extraordinarily tired.

Any other time, Jeira would have been awed at the idea of being married by the
Family, but right now all she feels is worry: if the situation is so dire that
Fardi are running _themselves_ ragged, filling the gaps of public servants with
their own numbers, things really are not well.

"Sit down, please," she implores him after they've been greeted. "You look like
you need a rest. Please."

A grateful smile and words of thanks, yet they soon get through the ceremony.

Beca hooks their arm into hers as they walk out.

"How about a honeymoon, hmm?"

They pull her down and brush their lips against hers. Jeira holds them closer
and kisses them deeply, before breaking away and turning back to the speeder,
expecting a playfully frustrated groan.

"Let's get back home first, dear." she smiled, taking her place and turning
to face Beca, who is already stepping forward.

"Mmm, yes, let's get some privacy, dearly mine. We'll need it."

When their daughter gets home, Beca fusses her hair and asks about homework and
does as if nothing has changed, as if the end of life as they know it hadn't
just been announced. Jeira hangs back at first, but when Beca places a plate of
biscuits and milk in front of the couch for Naema who's already looking through
her homework, she approaches.

She sits at her daughter's side, who turns to look and then sets aside her
datapad. Jeira raises an eyebrow.

“You're going to tell a story,” the child explains.

“And how do you figure that, Naema-mine?”

“You always get the same—” she tried to do something with her face, but only
succeeded in grimaces. “— and you sit differently.”

Jeira hmmmed and smiled. “So.”

“Wait.” Naema interrupted. “Ms Haron told us a story today. An old story, like
you and mama do. It was about… Etra and a herd of bantha.”

“I think I know the one. With the *djotu*?”

Naema nodded.

“She said there are some things, like the old stories, we shouldn't write down.
But then Mx Oriq in writing class said we should.”

“Ah. Did they say why? Either of them?”

Naema shook her head no.

“It's an old debate,” Jeira started. “One side says tradition should remain
spoken, so we remember it, and so it doesn't get lost. You know how sometimes
you write something down and then you forget about it because you can just look
it up? The other side says writing it down would help those who can't tell the
stories, or who can't hear them, and it would make it easier to archive our
history. They've been debating since before your grandmother was born.”

Naema frowned and thought about where she was on the issue.

“Where do you and mama stand?” she asked after a while.

“We think both are right, but I'll keep telling the stories nonetheless.”

“Mooom, that's not an answer!”

“A mix of both sides is good for everyone: the stories get recorded so history
is kept safe, and the less able can enjoy them and know them as well. And the
stories still get told and passed on and adapted so the tradition continues
living and doesn't become stuck. See? Both sides are right.”

Naema pouted for a second, then nodded.

“Now then.” Jeira began. “*A tele qa tele na rea, qen so Thabesqa roma te qoma,
shè fardima te riqitua araoma.*

“Once upon a time, there was a little girl…
