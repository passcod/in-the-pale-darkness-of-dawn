Jeira Santi gets married days before the first Imperial officer steps off his
shuttle and takes over governance of Thabeska. She was strongly advised to do
so during a Holonet conversation with Bren, who heard from Higor, who was
directed to relay the message by a Fardi. And she's seen the Holonews. This
doesn't feel like an exaggeration. Even the Holo forums are subdued.

The Empire is coming. The Empire has already claimed Thabeska as its own, less
than a week after the attempt on the Supreme Chancelor and the Jedi massacre
and the disbanding of the Republic.

The Empire is days old and already known for not being particularly kind to
anything that deviates from its model of what beings should look like and behave
like. Beings should look human; beings should obey.

Thabeska, in a way, is lucky: it had no native population on colonisation and
through the actions of fates and history is currently 90% humanoid. It is also
sufficiently far into the Outer Rim that a certain level of lawlessness will be
tolerated, according to the latest speculations. It also has a strong and old
tradition under a hybrid democratic and autocratic model. It's a small planet
with little in the way of valuable exports or resources, and it's not even on
any well-known traderoute.

The marriage frenzy is an administrative precaution, to create a flimsy proof
and Galactic-recognised guarantee. Families on Thabeska are usually documented
only internally, with the _fardishùma_, the family record, kept by each line
and branch. Only offworlders, rebellious youngsters, and families that
travelled to worlds where a Galactic-recognised union matterred had theirs
done; it had been on the Santi's todolist for some years now, along with a trip
to visit Beca's grandparents on Orinda, but they had never really needed it.

The ‘official’ marriage wouldn’t change anything: Jeira has been living with
Beca for more than ten years. They moved in together rather precipitously when
Beca got pregnant, but that was a long time ago now.

It doesn't help calm Jeira's nerves. She wishes they could have done this
properly. She frets as she tells Beca, but softens at their easy smile and
embraces them for reassurance.

"It'll be alright," they soothe. "We'll go tomorrow while Naema is at school."

It takes more time to get to the townhall and back than to go through the entire
process, even accounting for queuing. It's early yet in the morning, just before
ninth hour, and according to the flimsi they're given as they wait, they're the
47th family of the day.

Jeira calms a toddler for the family who got number 53 as the father calms his
partner, trying not to let her own anxiety show through, *but it's too late
now*, she tries to convince herself, and anyway they're being called on. Names
and ident chips are checked by a droid, their religious preference enquired on.
(No requirements for either of them; Jeira knows Beca's extended family
subscribes to a small Temple on their home planet, but they haven't visited in
years, nor practiced.) Too fast, they're guided to a chamber where a
volunteering Fardi is waiting, looking extraordinarily tired.

Any other time, Jeira would have been awed at the idea of being married by the
Family, but right now all she feels is worry: if the situation is so dire that
Fardi are running _themselves_ ragged, filling the gaps of public servants with
their own numbers, things really are not well.

"Sit down, please," she implores him after they've been greeted. "You look like
you need a rest. Please."

A grateful smile and words of thanks, yet they soon get through the ceremony,
and the flimsiwork that was the entire point of the exercise.

Beca hooks their arm into hers as they walk out.

"How about a honeymoon, hmm?"

They pull her down and brush their lips against hers. Jeira holds them closer
and kisses them deeply, before breaking away and turning back to the speeder,
expecting a playfully frustrated groan.

"Let's get back home first, dear." she smiled, taking her place and turning
to face Beca, who is already stepping forward.

"Mmm, yes, let's get some privacy, dearly mine. We'll need it."

--------

When their daughter gets home, Beca fusses her hair and asks about homework and
does as if nothing has changed, as if the end of life as they know it hadn't
just been announced. Jeira hangs back at first, but when Beca places a plate of
biscuits and milk in front of the couch for Naema who's already looking through
her homework, she approaches.

She sits at her daughter's side, who turns to look and then sets aside her
datapad. Jeira raises an eyebrow.

“You're going to tell a story,” the child explains.

“And how do you figure that, Naema-mine?”

“You always get the same—” she tried to do something with her face, but only
succeeded in grimaces. “— and you sit differently.”

Jeira hmmmed and smiled. “So.”

“Wait.” Naema interrupted. “Ms Haron told us a story today. An old story, like
you and mama do. It was about… Etra and a herd of bantha.”

“I think I know the one. With the *djotu*?”

Naema nodded.

“She said there are some things, like the old stories, we shouldn't write down.
But then Mx Oriq in writing class said we should.”

“Ah. Did they say why? Either of them?”

Naema shook her head no.

“It's an old debate,” Jeira started. “One side says tradition should remain
spoken, so we remember it, and so it doesn't get lost. You know how sometimes
you write something down and then you forget about it because you can just look
it up? The other side says writing it down would help those who can't tell the
stories, or who can't hear them, and it would make it easier to archive our
history. They've been debating since before your grandmother was born.”

Naema frowned and thought about where she was on the issue.

“Where do you and mama stand?” she asked after a while.

“We think both are right, but I'll keep telling the stories nonetheless.”

“Mooom, that's not an answer!”

“A mix of both sides is good for everyone: the stories get recorded so history
is kept safe, and the less able can enjoy them and know them as well. And the
stories still get told and passed on and adapted so the tradition continues
living and doesn't become stuck. See? Both sides are right.”

Naema pouted for a second, then nodded.

“Now then.” Jeira began. “*A tele qa tele na rea, qen so Thabesqa roma te qoma,
shè fardima te riqitua araoma.*

“Once upon a time, there was a little girl playing in the wild, not the far
wild, not the wastes, but only the little bit of wilderness behind her home. She
had often played there in her childhood, and her older brother, who was supposed
to be watching her, didn't think much of leaving her unsupervised for just a
moment as he went to fetch a glass of water.”

“Oh no!” exclaimed Naema, and then she shushed herself to hear the story.

“But today the little girl had heard a noise, and had approached the limits of
the property, curious as to what had made it. She hadn't learned to be cautious
yet, but she knew to follow her instincts, and nothing felt wrong to her.

There was an animal, with soft fur, short antlers, and cute ears, tall as she
was but larger and stronger on its four legs, although it was obvious, even in
to the little girl, that it was a youngling, not much older than she was in
their respective years.

She approached it slowly, not wanting to scare it away, and when she was right
next to it she softly started to pet it.”

Naema looked torn between awwing at the scene, and being scandalised at the
carelessness exhibited by the girl in the tale.

It was easy to forget that those tales had happened a long time ago, when
Thabeska was a softer world, mostly forests and rivers rather than mostly
deserts of sand and rock. In the Thabeska of the stories, animals were
approachable; in today's Thabeska, small children were taught what to do when
approached by wild beasts: look more threatening, back away without turning, and
in extreme cases light up a pocket flare to scare them. Modern-times animals in
the wild desert were not cute, and approaching them was _not_ a good idea.

“She smiled as she did so, but was very careful in not baring her teeth. She
stood confidently but loosely, without tensing. She took great care in only
thinking of peace and calm and the happiness she was exhuding.

The animal must have understood, because it turned aside unconcerned and kept at
its occupation, but it did not leave, accepting the petting. She grew bolder in
her strokes, but ever respectful.

When the animal had exhausted all that there was to eat in its little patch of
dirt, it moved away a little, and the little girl followed, petting and
caressing. And so it went, on and on, for the most part of a morning.”

“Oh no,” repeated Naema, very softly and almost without noticing it herself.

“So absorbed was she in her task, the little girl did not notice when the
ambient light darkened, and the air chilled, and the wind didn't blow freely
anymore. She was lead into the jungle, in a haphazard way according to the
whims of the gracious animal.

But suddenly there was a noise! And the animal stood at attention, little girl
forgotten in its worry, then bounded away swiftly away from the source of the
noise, leaving a disoriented child standing in the middle of… well, the little
girl realised she did not know where she was!

There was jungle and trees as far as she could see. Jungle forward, jungle back,
jungle to the right, jungle to the left, jungle above her, and she was stepping
on unfamiliar jungle ground.

She did not know how to read the jungle. She could not see through, nor glimpse
a clearing or even a structure. She could not remember what direction she had
come from, so surprised she had been by the sudden departure of her companion
for the morning.

Even if she could, the animal and her would have taken many a turn through their
advance into the forest. It had long gone, and she could see no other like it,
nor even any other creature of even half the size it had been.

She was lost.”

Jeira suppressed a smile at the horrified expression Naema was making, and
smirked slightly at Beca who had turned away from the stove to listen to the
story — they had heard this particular tale already, several times in fact. The
storytelling was what they were listening to, now and always; it was how they'd
met, actually.

“The little girl knew she could not remain in place. She started walking in a
direction, any direction, trying to stay her course steady and straight. She
used what little skylight she could see to guide herself. She did not speak, and
did not yell, for she knew, somehow, none would hear her that would be friendly.

Yet she opened her senses, her eyes, her ears, and she walked forward with a
good step, confidently, surely, but ready at all times to act on her
surroundings, as if she was a resident of this strange territory, and not the
lost little girl she knew she was now.

After a little while, she starting hearing murmurs. She stopped moving and
looked around, but she could not see where they could come from, and she picked
up her pace once again. It was as if the jungle itself was talking, guiding her
onwards, guiding her out, she hoped.

When she had trekked for what seemed hours, and the shadows were starting to
lengthen, she almost despaired, but another murmured chant joined with the first
she had been listening to. This time it was a clear and tingling sound, not too
far, not immediately close.

She altered her course to meet it, the soft and slow murmur of the jungle
soothing her fears.

She reached a gully,” _a small valley_, explained Beca to Naema, having joined
her on the sofa. “And she knew she was saved, for it would provide her—”

Jeira ignored the further whispered questions and explanations, but paused to
allow them. She remembered when she had original been told the story, and had
done the same with her grandmother, and when she had first told it to Beca, and
they had interrupted her every minute to request details — some she hadn't known
herself, and they had thrown themselves into study to discover all that the tale
was describing.

“The little girl knew she was saved, for the gully would provide for her as she
followed it down. She walked with renewed vigour, and at nightfall reached a
clearing of the woods, with a clear path, if grassy and not well trodden.

When the first stars climber into the sky, she saw low square dark shapes
cutting over the horizon. She was tired, lo, but she pulled herself up for the
last of her journey, and stepped right close to the first *arapatùma*, the first
hut she reached that had a ghost of light in its windows.

A threeknock she gave, and a threewhile she waited, and when the doorway opened,
light spilling outwards and warmth enveloping her, a tall being looking at her,
she spoke the words she was taught, she requested kindness, and she requested
rest. she starting speaking of being family of all the live over the land, but
she was already welcomed and fussed over and given bluemilk, the slumbering
embers stoked anew to heat her up.

She fell asleep softly but quickly, with the empty cup still warm in her hands.
When she woke it was morn, and another child was observing carefully.

- ‘Hello,’ said the other, and
- ‘Hello,’ said the little girl.

- ‘My name is Etra,’ said Etra, who had found a girl just like she was in _her
  spot_ upon waking.
- ‘My name is Watilda,’ replied the little girl, smiling uncertainly.
- ‘You're in my spot. But it's alright. Do you want bluemilk?’

And that is how Watilda met Etra.”

“Ooooh my stars” whispered Naema, “that was so cute. Is that one written down? I
want to share it with Trisha and Paula and, well, everyone. Or I could invite
them here? Or is it a *fardinanùma*?”

Jeira looked over her at Beca, who shook her head.

“Maybe later, *tutiri*. In a few weeks. It's a long story to tell.”

Naema nodded, and said thanks, and picked up her datapad again. Homework, or,
more likely, the Holochat channels she and her friends inhabited, beckoned.
