“See you tomorrow,” she called out before walking out. She stopped on the porch,
still within cover of three walls, and fitted her mask before adjusting her
hood, then stepping into the dust fog.
 
The sun was still out, but with its light and heat filtered by the dirt
suspended in the air, it was nippy. She tucked a loose fold into her belt,
repressed a shiver that wouldn't help, and started the long walk home. Another
day brushing the grime out of recycled components, another day avoiding her
supervisor at pause times, another walking into the dust instead of waiting with
the others for a barely climatised transport into the residential quarters. If
it had been a doubting day, if she'd convinced herself that she would always be
stuck here, in this job, on this dirt ball, she'd have taken the small comfort
and talked with Atali and Juko of the weather, the work, the co-workers, perhaps
even giggled shyly when topics veered to one's or the other's sex life. 

[](TK: add self-practice of looking for exits, quick-memorising of faces -- new
and regular -- and positions, cover space, weapons... while entering rooms /
walking about.)

But today she believed, so she walked, and she detoured through to the cantina,
nodded in the direction of the bar, waved after a greeting by another regular,
and passed into the backroom. There, she ignored the crokin tables, held her
breath through the haze of spice vapour, and headed to a little dark room. As
she pulled open the door, a Mon Calamari with his skin scarred from being
desicated, a consequence of living on a planet where water was at a premium,
according to his stories, leaned out and sniffed at the air, grimacing and
mumbling about storms. He noticed her and showed himself out, letting her have a
turn with a parting comment: “one day I'll beat your score, Naema, just you
wait.”
 
“One day.” She smirked as she closed the door, settled into the simulator, and
loaded the program for a takeoff from Takodana, wherever that may be. The lush
jungle was unlike anything she'd ever seen or was likely to see here, but
negotiating the foliage and giant fauna was a good warmup before switching to
hyperlane navigation on the Coruscanti traderoute, or the three dimensional
air-taxi traffic on busy Serenno.
 
After two hours in the box, she emerged and went to buy a drink at several times
the real price, in the agreed-upon way to compensate the owner and bartender for
the use of the facilities without eliciting undue suspicion.

Alexis noticed her coming out and shifted over, put his elbow on the bar so
close to her drink that she worried about him bumping it over for a moment, and
started talking at her. She smiled as gossip about everything from common
neighbourhood concerns to the colour of crops in the southern hemisphere's
farmlands to the score on the current games of... some sport she wasn't actually
sure the details of, as she'd stopped paying attention about five words into the
spiel.

The ritual was both about allowing the man a safe outlet for his innate desire
to talk the ear off someone with asinine details of the daily life of feral cats
around the city -- both real and metaphorical -- and a cover for anyone looking
in her direction. Alexis was as gay as they came, Naema was Not Interested, and
that effectively stopped anyone assuming otherwise having a try.

It was also a good way to share information, like the new route of the curfew
patrol. It was likely third or fourth hand information, her companion having
little use for it as he was a permantent resident of this very establishment, 
so not the most precise, but still good to know.

When she got back to her street, the sun was setting, leaving her with a
comfortable margin of minutes before curfew patrol was due to to pass through.
She unlocked her door with a bioscan, a security measure that was perhaps
overkill here, at the far edge of the city, but not so uncommon a few blocks
further towards the center that it would be noticed.

She steps in, closes the door behind her, and says hello to her parents' picture
in the hallway. The holo had been taken before Empire Day celebrations, in their
nicest garb, but without the backdrop of troopers nor Imperial decorations
hanging from official buildings yet.

She climbed up to the roof and looked at the ballet of shuttles coming and
leaving before the closing of the astroport. Today was a normal day in this
regard, which in her datapad's detailed notes, meant there was no regular
service arriving nor leaving. Thabeska wasn't visited by transport lines very
often. Most of the traffic was planet-local, and the little portion that was
interstellar was mostly Fardi cargo traffic, which ran on a random schedule, as
far as talking to drunk pilots and her own observations went.

When the second patrol clambered past her house, she sighed, looked at the
stars, hopeful and wishful both, and went to sleep.

She woke up with the dawn, shook the sleep off her eyes and breakfast off her
shelves, a quick trip to the fresher, a change of clothes. The same as the day
before, the same every day, no seventh day fancy-dress for her, not since she
was littler. She went to Empire Day each year, every year, as decreted, but wore
the same plain clothes for the Emperor. There was no one to frown, anymore.

She stepped onto the platform just as the transport arrived, same as ever
before, always on time, which meant always three minutes late. The public lines
used to run on time, but the delays were one of the ways the pilots rebelled.
Just enough to be defiant, not enough to be noticed, and predictable enough as
to not anger their passengers and endanger the bread they fed themselves with.

Naema joins Juko for her morning shift, lunches in the shade among other
coworkers, safer in a group. This week she believes she might one day escape.
She still doesn't know to where, or when, or what she'll do once she's away
(she's not hopeful enough to blindly believe whatever skills she picked up
working here or at the furnace previously would be marketable elsewhere), but
she believes.

Working is dull, life is dangerous, but hope makes it all bearable.

Patra Fardi looked up from his paperwork. Over the last four years, more and
more of the family business had needed to either be replaced by legal ventures
or hidden under approved smuggling. The Empire had discarded a lot of Republic
regulation, but one could not mistake the relaxing of laws for authorisation to
profit: instead the rules were established by the Imperial command on-planet
and within each jurisdiction, in a complex bureaucracy reft with egos and power
struggles, where what was allowed and what was tolerated could shift briskly
depending on who had most control or often, who was visiting the locality.

Record-keeping was now of the utmost importance. It had to be done
meticulously, with every movement and every transfer, every sale, every hire,
registered and justified and filed in triplicate in several secure places.
Raids and controls by Imperials, often accompanied by Stormtroopers, were
frequent, even with the benediction of the local figurehead. Anything out of
place, and he would have to spend days helping skeptical officers to go through
months or years of business backlogs.

It was exhausting. It made running the Family smuggling operations harder than
ever, and harder every year, almost getting impossible. But Patra would not
give up. He had promised his Da, all these years ago, not to give up the family
business, and not to give up the Family's place on Thabeska. The latter, Patra
thought he had already failed. The Empire was too cruel, too strict, too
unforgiving. Bribes didn't work anymore, and helping Thabeskan civilians and
industries was seen as interfering with local Imperial command. The Thabeskan
people suffered, and all he could do while subjected to the regime's oversight
was keep away other criminal enterprises.

There was no sentient trafficking on Thabeska. Only Empire-stamped spice passed
through, and it passed through them, and none of it stopped here. Gambling he
could not control, but that was one area the Empire did not tolerate either.
Prostitution had long been legal, a holdover from their Nabooan ancient
history, and its illegal aspects were, if present, at least thankfully very
rare. Extortion was a problem, but not technically of the criminal variety —
when the government itself extorts its citizens, it does not appreciate
competition.

What remained was the slicing industry, which nobody was foolish enough to try
to stop, and violent organised crime, what one of his children called the seven
asses: assassination, assault, assailing, assizing, asset recovery, and
Assegai, the local arms trade.

Children were the future, and the present. They'd had to keep nimble as a
family, they'd had to break tradition, in order to survive effectively. Patra
could admit that he'd initially been wrong on this. It was only after a lot of
arguing with his wife, with his cousins, with his older daughters and nieces,
and some soul-searching, that he'd conceded and accepted to, on a trial basis,
let young Fardi _not_ train to fly, and instead train in other parts of the
business first and foremost. And it had saved them.

While the oldest of the still young, like Chenna or Sitra, were already too
advanced in flying to give up or change, they had subtly transitioned to also
training as ship command, or taken up side-skills to shore up crews at short
notice when needed, as the Imperial presence had stiffled recruiting.

The younger ones, however, had been the most interesting. His daughter Malaka
along with a tight-knit group of her cousins, had taken an interest in strategy
and planning, and exceeded expectations by anything he'd imagined: after two
years, joined by initially intrigued, and then highly engaged, older members of
the Family, spouses, and even trusted outsiders, they had formed a Working Group
that had relieved a heavy part of his duties as Clan Head. He kept final say and
was very careful not to get sidelined; as tempting as it was to offload all
work, he was ultimately Clan head, and that came with responsibilities.

Yes, this change, and the other changes it engendered, despite his first
opposition, despite breaking with tradition, had been the best thing to happen
to the Fardi under the Empire, and possibly after it.

(For he had no doubt the Empire would end. It might not be within the rest of
his lifetime, but it would happen. It was too violent, too cruel, too injust.
Unsustainably so. Whether by the current growing rebellion he'd had a glimpse
in with a Togruta employee several years ago, or by another movement, or by
imploding on itself, it would end. He was certain of it.)

He made a mental note to find a gift in thanks for his wife.

The biggest surprise had been little Hedala. As the youngest, she'd come into
her apprenticing period onto an already well-developed system. Initially
undecided, she had tried just about everything, every aspect she could be
involved in, before falling back to flying. And that's where she found an
interest and talent: the complex mathematics of hyperspace travel.

He'd learned more about that field than he'd ever had an appreciation for as the
barely pubescent girl talked his (and everyone else's) ears off whenever she
found a victim, and he was often available. He'd learned to do work while
listening, and had developed a nostalgia for a gone time when cuddles were the
only danger to being near an idle Hedala.

(It turned out that while most pilots left hyperspace travel calculus to
navigation computers, doing it manually meant one could add sapient knowledge
and intuition — something that the kid seemed to have in spades — and pull
inventive maneuvers or daring techniques or, more often, get some sweet fuel
economy going by using gravity wells instead of avoiding them, like the
conservative navicomps usually do. Of course it's horrifically more complicated
and what little of the math Patra understands makes his brain go fuzzy.)

Chenna, upon finding her little sister firmly ensconsced in a front of a holo on
the subject after returning from a long courier to the Illisurevimurasi sector,
had made her promise never, under any circumstance, to ever attempt the Kessel
run. After subsequently hearing about it, he agreed.

For now, to everyone's relief, Hedala stayed on Thabeska, calculating routes
theoretically and testing them using a simulator. He knew that wouldn't last,
but he was determined to let it go for as long as possible.

Children were the future, and they were the present. Most importantly, they were
too precious and adorable to let go quite so soon.
