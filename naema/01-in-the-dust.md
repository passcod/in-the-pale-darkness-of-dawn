“See you tomorrow,” she called out before walking out. She stopped on the
porch, still within cover of three walls, and fitted her mask before adjusting
her hood, then stepping into the dust fog.
 
The sun was still out, but with its light and heat filtered by the dirt
suspended in the air, it was nippy. She tucked a loose fold into her belt,
repressed a shiver that wouldn't help, and started the long walk home. Another
day brushing the grime out of recycled components, another day avoiding her
supervisor at pause times, another walking into the dust instead of waiting
with the others for a barely climatised transport into the residential
quarters. If it had been a doubting day, if she'd convinced herself that she
would always be stuck here, in this job, on this dirt ball, she'd have taken
the small comfort and talked with Atali and Juko of the weather, the work, the
co-workers, perhaps even giggled shyly when topics veered to one's or the
other's sex life. 
 
But today she believed, so she walked, and she detoured through to the cantina,
nodded in the direction of the bar, waved after a greeting by another regular,
and passed into the backroom. There, she ignored the [TK game] tables, held her
breath through the haze of spice vapour, and headed to a little dark room. As
she pulled open the door, a Mon Calamari with his skin scarred from being
desicated, a consequence of living on a planet where water was at a premium,
according to his stories, leaned out and sniffed at the air, grimacing and
mumbling about storms. He noticed her and showed himself out, letting her have
a turn with a parting comment: “one day I'll beat your score, Naema, just you
wait.”
 
“One day.” She smirked as she closed the door, settled into the simulator, and
loaded the program for a takeoff from Takodana, wherever that may be. The lush
jungle was unlike anything she'd ever seen or was likely to see here, but
negotiating the foliage and giant fauna was a good warmup before switching to
hyperlane navigation on the Coruscant traderoute, or the three dimensional
air-taxi traffic on busy Serenno.
 
After two hours in the box, she emerged and went to buy a drink at several
times the real price, in the agreed-upon way to compense the owner and
bartender for the use of the facilities without eliciting undue suspicion.
