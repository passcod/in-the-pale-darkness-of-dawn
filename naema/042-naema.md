“See you tomorrow,” she calls out before walking out. She stops on the porch,
still within cover of three walls, fits her mask, adjusts her
hood, and steps into the dusty fog.
 
The sun is still out, but with its light and heat filtered by the dirt
suspended in the air, it's nippy. She tucks a loose fold into her belt,
represses a shiver that wouldn't help, and starts the long walk home. Another
day brushing the grime out of recycled components, another day avoiding her
supervisor at pause times, another walking into the dust instead of waiting with
the others for a barely climatised transport into the residential quarters.

If it had been a doubting day, if she'd convinced herself that she would always
be stuck here, in this job, on this dirt ball, she'd have taken the small
comfort and talked with Atali and Juko of the weather, the work, the
co-workers, perhaps even giggled shyly when topics veered to one's or the
other's sex life. She'd have gotten home early, and fixed food on autopilot,
and gone to sleep hoping for a calm night. 

[](TK: add self-practice of looking for exits, quick-memorising of faces -- new
and regular -- and positions, cover space, weapons... while entering rooms /
walking about.)

But today she believes in her dream, so she walks.

After a year of dreaming on her own, of not knowing what to do, she had started
logging everything she could, documenting comings and goings around routes she
chose to walk rather than what would have been the shortest way, so she could
spend some time in Astro Avenue, the street that the spaceport gave out onto, or
Imperial Lane, where the Officements and barracks were. She still didn't know
what to do, what she was looking for. She didn't even know if there was
something to be found. But she hoped.

She'd been taught how to look and walk in different ways to deflect attention or
redirect it by a matron who had caught her walking the same path for the fifth
time in a row. She had been too naive. She learned.

She found that many people dreamed of escaping, and many didn't but still knew
how to play the game and cheat at it and not get caught. She bartered the
knowledge of what to say to the droid in charge of water supply to get two
portions daily rather than one against clean cloth her parents would never wear
again. Then she bribed a bouncer with that knowledge into letting her in the
tavern part of the cantina despite not being nearly old enough.

(There were other ways should could have gotten in, but she felt hollow just
thinking about them.)

and she detoured through to the cantina,
nodded in the direction of the bar, waved after a greeting by another regular,
and passed into the backroom. There, she ignored the crokin tables, held her
breath through the haze of spice vapour, and headed to a little dark room.

Walking there, she glanced at the exits, remembered every hiding place she'd
figured out, and used her swerving around a table in her path to sweep the
entire room and quickly estimate the number of people in the room, their
species, how they were dressed, what she thought that said about them. There
was no risk here, but it was practice. Always practice. Get anywhere new,
anywhere that might have changed: observe, gather information, do so quickly,
do so discreetly.

She admitted to herself that she might have cribbed a lot of those habits from
holodramas, but she'd tried to do her diligence in looking up — ever so
carefully through the controlled and most certainly spied upon access to the
Holonet she had — actual information and techniques. At least to eliminate the
very wrong.

An obvious source of good technique was Fardi-affiliated people. They higher
they were, the more experienced… but also the harder to watch and learn from,
in consequence. And she wasn't about to approach any of them directly, even at
lower levels. The Galaxy was Imperial, at the moment, and in any case Thabeska
was in the Outer Rim. Trust was nuanced and tiered, and trust in strangers
wasn't very high up on the list.

Another obvious source were the stormtroopers. Despite having a perennial
reputation for being very bad shots, and generally bad at everything (she
suspected a lot of that was government propaganda designed to lure potential
antagonists in a false sense of security, but she also had never been very
close to a firefight involving stormtroopers — or any firefight for this
matter), troopers were trained. They'd all gone several years in the Academy,
and there they were presumably taught all kinds of things she'd have loved to
know in a standardised manner.

She'd briefly considered joining the Academy. But that was _not_ happening. So
instead she took to observing its graduates, which doubled as stealth and
patience and sight-taking practice all in one. There weren't that many troopers
on Thabeska, she knew from holos and the news, but it still felt like a lot.
You never really got used to it. Nobody did, as much as they pretended, if only
to themselves. Conversations dimmed, eyes were cast down, lekku were relaxed,
nerves were tensed.

It comforted her, to see that despite the Empire being a reality for a third of
her life now, it wasn't completely normalised. [][TK continue there]



As she pulled open the door, a Mon Calamari with his skin scarred from being
desicated, a consequence of living on a planet where water was at a premium,
according to his stories, leaned out and sniffed at the air, grimacing and
mumbling about storms. He noticed her and showed himself out, letting her have a
turn with a parting comment: “one day I'll beat your score, Naema, just you
wait.”
 
“One day.” She smirked as she closed the door, settled into the simulator, and
loaded the program for a takeoff from Takodana, wherever that may be. The lush
jungle was unlike anything she'd ever seen or was likely to see here, but
negotiating the foliage and giant fauna was a good warmup before switching to
hyperlane navigation on the Coruscanti traderoute, or the three dimensional
air-taxi traffic on busy Serenno.
 
After two hours in the box, she emerged and went to buy a drink at several times
the real price, in the agreed-upon way to compensate the owner and bartender for
the use of the facilities without eliciting undue suspicion.

Alexis noticed her coming out and shifted over, put his elbow on the bar so
close to her drink that she worried about him bumping it over for a moment, and
started talking at her. She smiled as gossip about everything from common
neighbourhood concerns to the colour of crops in the southern hemisphere's
farmlands to the score on the current games of... some sport she wasn't actually
sure the details of, as she'd stopped paying attention about five words into the
spiel.

The ritual was both about allowing the man a safe outlet for his innate desire
to talk the ear off someone with asinine details of the daily life of feral cats
around the city -- both real and metaphorical -- and a cover for anyone looking
in her direction. Alexis was as gay as they came, Naema was Not Interested, and
that effectively stopped anyone assuming otherwise having a try.

It was also a good way to share information, like the new route of the curfew
patrol. It was likely third or fourth hand information, her companion having
little use for it as he was a permantent resident of this very establishment, 
so not the most precise, but still good to know.

When she got back to her street, the sun was setting, leaving her with a
comfortable margin of minutes before curfew patrol was due to to pass through.
She unlocked her door with a bioscan, a security measure that was perhaps
overkill here, at the far edge of the city, but not so uncommon a few blocks
further towards the center that it would be noticed.

She steps in, closes the door behind her, and says hello to her parents' picture
in the hallway. The holo had been taken before Empire Day celebrations, in their
nicest garb, but without the backdrop of troopers nor Imperial decorations
hanging from official buildings yet.

She climbed up to the roof and looked at the ballet of shuttles coming and
leaving before the closing of the astroport. Today was a normal day in this
regard, which in her datapad's detailed notes, meant there was no regular
service arriving nor leaving. Thabeska wasn't visited by transport lines very
often. Most of the traffic was planet-local, and the little portion that was
interstellar was mostly Fardi cargo traffic, which ran on a random schedule, as
far as talking to drunk pilots and her own observations went.

When the second patrol clambered past her house, she sighed, looked at the
stars, hopeful and wishful both, and went to sleep.

She woke up with the dawn, shook the sleep off her eyes and breakfast off her
shelves, a quick trip to the fresher, a change of clothes. The same as the day
before, the same every day, no seventh day fancy-dress for her, not since she
was littler. She went to Empire Day each year, every year, as decreted, but wore
the same plain clothes for the Emperor. There was no one to frown, anymore.

She stepped onto the platform just as the transport arrived, same as ever
before, always on time, which meant always three minutes late. The public lines
used to run on time, but the delays were one of the ways the pilots rebelled.
Just enough to be defiant, not enough to be noticed, and predictable enough as
to not anger their passengers and endanger the bread they fed themselves with.

Naema joins Juko for her morning shift, lunches in the shade among other
coworkers, safer in a group. This week she believes she might one day escape.
She still doesn't know to where, or when, or what she'll do once she's away
(she's not hopeful enough to blindly believe whatever skills she picked up
working here or at the furnace previously would be marketable elsewhere), but
she believes.

Working is dull, life is dangerous, but hope makes it all bearable.
