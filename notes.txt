Parody jokes as disclaimer play for J J Abrams, George Lucas, Lawrence Kasdan, Michael Arndt, order randomised every chapter and first mentioned rotating. First joke always Chuck Norris style, then the rest as various references: Marauders, 3 little pigs, etc. Never actually referring to Star Wars material.

Pronouns:
- neutral for everyone
- chosen pronouns denote status and respect.

Kylo is he/his, but almost all stormtroopers and staff under his command are they/them. Someone aware of this custom and wanting to insult Kylo could use they/them pronouns when referring to him.

Phasma is an Admiral, not merely a Captain, and properly part of the commanding triumvirate with General Hux and Master Kylo.

Hux is responsible for the SKB, all ground troops and strategy, and a First Order fanatic. Kylo is responsible for the Knights of Ren, special and precision missions, and answers to the Force. Phasma is responsible for ships and logistics, the Navy part of the military, and prides herself on exactitude and ultimate performance.

Kylo was born in 5 ABY.

He publicly turned to the Dark Side around age 23.

At time of Attack on Tuanul (start of TFA) he was 29.

Kylo wants to destroy the Jedi Order... but not the way Hux and Snoke think of. Kylo believes the Jedi Order was already antiquated at the time of Anakin, and wants to reform it.

Kylo keeps the mangled mask of Darth Vader as a reminder of the failure of the Jedi Order, which let one of its most powerful members become overwhelmed by emotions while being told to ignore them, and prohibited the study of the so-called Dark Side leading to them being defenceless against it when the Sith used it, among other failures he attributes to the Jedi Order.

Kylo learned under Luke, but wanted to learn about all of the Force, not just the limited education of the so-called Light Side. Thus, he allowed himself to be tempted to the Dark Side by Snoke, gaining a mentor in the Dark arts.

Kylo was involved in the destruction of Luke's Jedi. Haven't decided yet how I want this to have gone. One possibility:

Kylo was ordered by Snoke to destroy Luke's order. Of course, Kylo didn't want to kill his friends and hurt his loved ones, but he also wanted to ingratiate himself with Snoke. At the same time, he couldn't simply fail at destroying the Jedi, as they would then fall to another attack ordered by Snoke. So Kylo immersed himself in Sith texts found in the Empire Archives, and learned an advanced form of Force Stasis, which he used to put Luke's Jedi to sleep until they could be revived, possibly years. He orchestrated a brutal attack on the Jedi, as played by Force-controlled slavers he had captured, and set fire to the Jedi Temple they were staying at to erase trace of his manipulations.

Kylo surrounds himself with advisors, who know of his desires, or at least some of them. With them, he has planned for a break from Snoke and Hux, as well as various other possibilities. Without them, he also has planned for a complete break if he was to be betrayed, or if it was needed for him to disappear.

The Knights of Ren was both a promotion by Snoke, and a way to watch Kylo and make sure he behaves. Kylo knows this, and his plans include breaking away from the Knights. At the same time, he is torn because of the companionship he found with the Knights during his apprenticeship.

While Snoke is busy being Supreme Leader, both Hux and Kylo make ample use of simulations to predict and guide their choices.

Hux's goal is the absolute rule of the First Order, and thus the destruction of its enemies: the Jedi, the Resistance, the New Republic, and worlds not under the First Order's control, in this order.

Kylo's goal is the reformation of the Jedi. That makes him an independent force in all conflicts, simultaneously for and against most other actors. He has a strong moral code, but one which differs from both the absolutes of the First Order and the Jedi. He abhors unnecessary death, and even has nightmares about people whose death he deemed necessary, second-guessing himself all the time. At the same time, he does believe that some death is necessary, and is doubtful about redemption; he also accepts that not everyone may be saved right now, that even while he is working towards reducing the amount of suffering in the Galaxy, he sometimes has to make terrible choices so as not to derail his plans and fail before he has a chance to act.

In this fic, the conditions necessary for SW:TFA to begin never occur:

- Kylo has established measures for stormtroopers and staff under his command that improve work and living conditions, as well as loyalty and earned respect. Thus, Finn (UID FN-2187) is content with his station and doesn't desert.

- Kylo doesn't believe in unnecessary death, so he never orders the killing of civilians during the Attack on Tuanul. In fact, none of the attackers have the authorisation to set their blasters higher than stun, and all have orders to keep confrontation to a minimum.

- Kylo doesn't kill Lor San Tekka after questioning him.

- Poe doesn't engage Kylo's forces, as he is trying to approach Lor San Tekka, and the forces aren't being violent, so there is little need for him to be senselessly captured and injured, and even less need to present the Resistance in a bad light by creating a confrontation within a civilian area without just cause.

However, there are events still going on:

- BB-8 and Poe are separated during the initial panic when Kylo arrives to Tuanul (sure, Kylo is *known* for the above, but at the same time it's not really easy for random civilians to recognise which of the triumvirate a particular shuttle belongs to, at a glance). BB-8 finds Rey, recognises her as being Force-sensitive, and decides to stay around her as that's a better chance to be led to the Resistance, or at least to follow in the guidance of the Force.

- Rey witnesses the interaction between Kylo and Lor San Tekka, and is shocked to learn that the Jedi are real. Kylo detects a Force-sensitive, sees Rey and thinks he might recognise her, but doesn't know from where. Using a passive Force Scan, he gleans from her thoughts her pitiful existence as a scavenger on Jakku. He is briefly tempted to approach her and remove her from poverty, but the Force pushes him to ignore this.

- Poe searches for BB-8 but cannot find it. After Kylo (seemingly) departs from Jakku, he contacts the Resistance and asks for help to recover BB-8.

Moreover, the New Republic capital worlds are not destroyed by Starkiller Base:

Hux wants to, but this interferes with Kylo's plans. Given that Hux's goals include the destruction of the Jedi, Kylo thinks he may be able to influence Hux **not** to destroy the capital worlds if this would help kill the Jedi faster.

Kylo thinks that the key to Luke's position on the galactic map may have a good chance to be located on the capital worlds. Thus, destroying the worlds before finding the key would significantly slow down the search for Luke.

Nevertheless, Kylo knows that Hux will never be convinced by thoughts and conjectures, so he orders a series of simulations done to estimate:

- Whether the key is likely to be within the capital worlds (given to workgroup PK-8491), and
- How long it would take to crack the key by brute-force (given to workgroup PK-9135).

**This is where the fic starts.**

He receives both reports and sends his conclusions.

Meanwhile, he carries out training with the Knights of Ren, and takes them on a short recon mission on a world where intelligence placed a small covert Resistance presence: Morellia. A secondary objective is to possibly find traces of Wild Space map data possibly left by the Graf family.

While there, Kylo receives a transmission that seems to originate from the dead planet Malachor. **and leave it at that**

(Malachor is where Tano was last seen, but don't say that in the text. The entire Tano presence is a very lightly evoked "extra plot" that may be explored in a sequel, or is just a hint/homage for savvy readers otherwise.)

The triumvirate meets to discuss the information and decide on further action.

Hux is unmoved from his conviction, as he indicates that he has received intelligence that the key might be in the hands of Lor San Tekka, whom Admiral Phasma traced to Jakku.

Kylo volunteers to go investigate, presumably so that Hux may remain on Starkiller Base to oversee final preparations, and be ready to execute the destruction of the capital worlds as soon as word of the recovery of the key comes back.

Phasma will move the First Order navy in anticipation of either the destruction of the capital worlds and monitoring that plus destroying any remnants, or the infiltration of the worlds in search of the Key if word comes back to that effect.

Kylo, on his side, prepares several of his plans:

- He leaves several platoons on Starkiller Base with orders to stay at critical places (the cooling plant, the weapon's firing mechanisms, the communication center, the shield generator), ready to disable SKB if necessary.

- He leaves with them emergency orders to disable SKB if it starts to be powered on and targeted before he comes back.

**At this point he actually starts for Jakku.**

- He prepares for his schism from the First Order.

- He directs his fleet to subtly start moving towards neutral territory, and to prepare to drop identifications and disguise themselves as much as possible.

- He sends a message to Ahsoka Tano, telling her he's beginning to move. [See: snippets/message-to-tano.md]

**After arriving on Jakku, but before going for Tekka.**

- He prepares for his escape from the Knights of Ren, becoming simply "Kylo", and not "Kylo Ren".

**See above for what happens around this.**

San Tekka is found and Kylo interrogates him, far more gently than San Tekka expects. Kylo finds that the key is contained within Luke's lightsaber. He relays this information to Hux, believing that the most likely place for the lightsaber is within the capital worlds. However, Hux believes that if it was, they would say so publicly, as the lightsaber is a huge symbol, so he orders the strike.

As soon as Kylo learns of the decision, he triggers some of his plans.

Kylo debarks a smaller shuttle, and orders his command shuttle along with his advisors, crew, staff, and troops to go back to SKB and help the forces he left there to stop the strike, cripple the Base if possible, and engage schism protocols.

He hides from the Knights of Ren so they remain on board the command shuttle, believing him to be there too, while he stays on Jakku with his smaller shuttle until the Knights and other First Order presence is far enough away that he can move.

Finn is directed by a rebel faction (Finn's unit was trained directly under Admiral Phasma for a time) within Kylo's forces to stay on Jakku to spy on Kylo. However, Finn is loyal to Kylo first, and to the First Order only through Kylo's perceived loyalty to the First Order. Kylo is responsible for the changes to stormtrooper culture, and Finn is grateful that they do not have to kill any more innocents, as they did several times prior to being moved to Kylo's troops.

Kylo decides to seek out the Force-sensitive he detected while meeting with Lor San Tekka, while worrying about how his plans are going.

Finn is following Kylo, and going through their own identity crisis as they learn more about Kylo while he goes about behaving very differently from the image he projected while a part of the First Order.

Rey is still a scavenger, but now has the companionship of BB-8.

Poe searches for BB-8 and is in communication with the Resistance.

**End of Part I**
