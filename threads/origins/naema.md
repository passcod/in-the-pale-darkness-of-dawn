[][TK: Naema, human female, she/her, dark skin, a worker on Thabeska, far below
the notice of the Fardi Family. She heard about the theft and escape of Tano
(although she obv didn't know her identity, or anything much else), and that
convinced her escape was possible. In 12 BBY (at 17 yo), after years of
preparing and planning and self-doubt, she first stowed away on a shuttle then
took it over once they were in hyperspace, jumping soon after arriving at
{destination} and tossing the crew out in an escape pod. Most of the crew, that
is. On board was also Hedala Fardi (14 yo, but she looked older), who somehow
knew about Naema, but struck a tacit deal to go with in exchange for not giving
her up. They fought together as independent insurgents and eventually joined
the Rebellion in the hopes of having more chances to help Thabeska. Awed as she
was by the powerful figures of Mon Mothma and Leia, though, Naema was
ultimately disappointed by the Alliance and the New Republic. Hedala went back
to her family for a while, but came back, ostentiously to help, but really to
be with Naema. She kept in contact, though, and while her family hoped to
regain the upper hand on the planet, it was slow going against the thugs that
were left in place.]

[][TK: timeline
19 BBY  -- Ahsoka arrives on Thabeska (vague reference as short memory).

18 BBY  -- Ahsoka is working for the Fardis (not mentioned).
        -- Hedala (7) starts to manifest (very short flashback - 1/2 phrases).
EmpireD -- Ahsoka steals the Fardis' shuttles and escapes (indirect mention).
        -- Naema (11) hears about it.

        -- Hedala (8) is watched by a shadow (not mentioned).

17 BBY  -- Ahsoka comes back (not mentioned).
        -- Hedala (9) tells Ahsoka about the shadow (vague reference).
        -- Ahsoka leaves again (not mentioned).

12 BBY  -- Hedala (14) is on a Fardi transport to ???.
        -- Naema (17) stows away on that transport.
        -- Hedala senses Naema and lets her hijack so long as she comes with.
        -- Hedala hides a message to her family in a last transmission.
        -- The Fardi family publicly grieves for her disappearance.

10 BBY  -- Hedala (16) and Naema (19) are on a smuggling run when they encounter Rebels.
        -- They're not yet ready to trust others, though, and they have contracts still.

 7 BBY  -- Waiting for an Empire training exercise to finish before they take off from
           Cargamalis before after transacting with a smuggler known as Riley.
        -- Naema (21) surprises Hedala (19) with a birthday present.

 6 BBY  -- Naema (23) goes to a Rebels meet organised on the Tsoss asteroid, in the
           Deep Core, closer to the Galactic Center black hole than most planets,
           and where communications are too warped for spying. Hedala (20) waits in
           far orbit, hidden but watching through the Force, ready to come in to
           help if she senses distress, or to (reluctantly) flee if she senses
           Naema dying.
        -- Hedala and Naema officially join the Rebellion.

 4 BBY  -- Hedala (22) and Naema (25) wait in asteroid Slayn's shadow for a Verpine
           ship they have been tasked to get a secure datapad to.

 3 BBY  -- As a favour to Garazeb Orrelios, Hedala (23) and Naema (26) provide
           passage for Zeb's grandmother to Lira San. They wonder about the Hammerhead
           corvettes rumoured to have been introduced to the Rebellion, but Hedala
           is fond of their shuttle as it is a connection to her family.

 1 BBY  -- Some runs to Ryloth, airdropping supplies to the Insurgency (mention only).

 0 ABY  -- Hedala (26) collapses from the Force backlash of the destruction of Alderaan.
           She stays unconscious for a few days in her shuttle, and misses the hyperspace
           exit and subsequent rendezvous with Naema (29) and an Alliance contact.
        -- Naema and the Alliance contact's cell find Hedala's ship drifting through
           space, and make contact with Hedala, who is trying to repair the comms array
           which was damaged along with the hyperdrive. They have news of Alderaan, but
           Hedala doesn't register the coincidence until much later.

 4 ABY  -- Hedala and Naema receive news of the Emperor's death while on a run to Akiva.
        -- Hedala travels to Thabeska while Naema stays on Chandrilla.
        -- Hedala returns.

 5 ABY  -- Hedala and Naema, along with others Rebels, are displeased with the terms of
           the Galactic Concordance, notably because they feel the New Republic is
           abandoning those worlds that are still under Imperial control to their fate.

 6 ABY  -- Hedala and Naema, along with many other Rebels, independents, and jaded
           ex-Alliance or ex-New Republic personnel, politicians, activists, civilians,
           refugees, fighters, pilots, nomads, traders, etc... assemble to create and
           Declare the Resistance, a new faction expressely dedicated to a free galaxy.
