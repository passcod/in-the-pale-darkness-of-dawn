[TK: charname] finished giving an overview of the way the Resistance government
and organisation functioned at the moment, as well as some hints about what
they wanted to achieve in the future. He then switched off the holo and turned
back to Leia with a warm expression.

"We're glad to have you, Leia."

She smiled, but then frowned slightly as something occurred to her:

"Wait, 'The Resistance'? Isn't that a bit of a misnomer for what is clearly a
well-established government and administration?"

"Ah. Yes. We were 'the Resistance' at first, when it was just the non-Repbulic
parts of the Alliance hanging out together, and then we were busy organising,
and then we started discussing better names but nobody could find something we
all agreed on… so in the meantime, the name stuck. We came to be known as the
Resistance by others, and… well, it's not a terrible name."

He sounded somewhat apologetic, which perplexed Leia a bit, so she asked about
it.

"Um, well. Some of" he made a vague gesture "us wanted to call it Starflower,
in honour of…"

"Alderaan." she breathed.

"Yes. But, well."

"It didn't take?"

"Oh, it did, with those who remembered… but it was too late, I think. As I
said, people were already associating the name — the Resistance — with us."

Something scratched at Leia's subconscious, although she couldn't place what it
was, until she glanced down at the flims on the table, and noticed the
letterhead.

"The insignia is representing a starflower."

[TK: charname] smiled.

"It was what we could do. It works well, I think."

"It's lovely." She closed her eyes, remembering a grassy plain, playing in
sunlight. Then composed herself, and said softly: "Thank you."

"Always, Princess."
