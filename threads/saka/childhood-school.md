She was born on the year 3653, a few months after the new year. Her mother
often told her, as a child, how she had felt her baby wanted to come into the
world right now, please and thank you. It was certainly unexpectedly early. The
significance of the date would come to Saka only much later.

Right now, Saka was at school and it was the year 3663. Much more important
than the year, though, was the day: she'd protested, quietly, then loudly, then
quietly again after getting a Look, about being forced to go to boring school
on her birthday. Her tenth birthday! Surely that was an important enough
reason.

"It's the law, Saka."

The law, the law, peh, who cared about the law? Everyone, apparently. Well, not
her play friends, who always were very easy to outrage on anyone else's behalfâ€¦
but unfortunately also very easy to cowe with a sharp look from a senior or an
adult.

So Saka begrudgingly sat and listened in class, as if it was just another
normal day.
