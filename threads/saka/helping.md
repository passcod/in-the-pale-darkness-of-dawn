"Why are you helping us?" the masked figure asks.

Phasma thinks on that question. It's not about right or wrong, or fuzzy
philosophical concepts like that. It's not about this particular instance of
helping, either, although she doubts her interlocutor knew about all the other
previous ones, too. She's also not going to tell them about wanting to see the
stars, her dream. And she's not yet revealing what who she is and what she
knows of important and terrifying plans.

"All rules end. Eventually. If it wasn't you, even if you would be defeated, to
the last being… there would be an uprising, sooner or later. And at some point,
one will succeed and this rule will end. I come from…" she hesitates, wondering
briefly if she should divulge that tidbit of information, then figures there's
others like her; it's not uncommon anymore. "I come from beyond the Rim. I
never knew the Old Republic. But also, I wasn't born in the First Order or the
Empire.

"All rules end, and I believe you'll be the ones to achieve it, this time."

"So you want to be on the winning side when it happens." the figure states.

"That's not quite— Yes. I suppose you could say it like that."

It feels a bit _vain_ when told like that. But Phasma doesn't need — doesn't
_want_ — to reveal everything about herself to a stranger. She might be as
certain as she'll be that they are a Resistance agent, and more, that they are
able (authorised? recognised? this she doesn't know) to negotiate or bring her
in or otherwise accept her, at least provisionally. But that's a situational
connection, not a personal one. All she wants is for whomever they are to think
her reasons good enough. So she doesn't say more.
