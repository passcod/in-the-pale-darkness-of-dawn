"Could you please avoid terminating so many troopers?" she asked, although none

"No, look, I know you need to enforce _disclipline_," and Phasma barely managed
to refrain from rolling her eyes, "but we're not in Union terrirory right now.

"Alright, alright." Hux found his haughtiness again and finished: "I'll have to
find _other_ ways to maintain quality, then."
