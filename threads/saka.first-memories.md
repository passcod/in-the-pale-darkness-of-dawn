The first thing she remembers is her mother crying and the blur of hyperspace
out the transport's window. She does not remember her father. She remembers her
mother hugging her close, too tightly, and wriggling out of her grasp to go
play with the carpet and the cold metal floor, tracing with her hands the
pockmarks and the scratches and the imprints stamped into the durasteel.

She remembers her fourth birthday, because it was the first time she had blue
milk, and because she moved into her own room, in a brand new house. Her very
own door along with blocky decals she couldn't read yet but knew meant her
name, from when her mother pointed and cared caressed the symbols and spoke her
name to teach her. Saka.

She remembers her mother smiling a lot during that time. She remembers the
little selonian in the house next door, with whom she played a lot, running
along the grass and climbing at trees. She does not remember their name, but
she remembers their pale blue fur that darkened in the rain. She remembers her
mother scolding her for staying out in the downpour, and feeling it was
terribly unfair how her friend could stay out and be wet and not have to care,
but promptly forgetting all about that when she saw them all puffy and cross
from the vigorous drying their father had applied.
