- [Context: Leia is lost after Ben turned to the dark side. There's a asymmetry
  of information, as Luke has really come through fast to bring the news and
  has told different fragments to different people. To Leia, he's told that Ben
  has gone to the dark side, but not that he betrayed and possibly killed the
  new generation of Jedi. To the Resistance, he's told that the new Jedi have
  been attacked, that there's high casualties, and to invalidate all the codes
  several people may have had access to; including Ben Solo. So the Resistance
  suspects Ben has gone traitor, although they don't know for sure; as a result
  they're somewhat perhaps hostile quietly behind closed doors to the Solo
  family, but at the same time a lot of them worked with Leia over the Empire
  years, so it's a confusing time and confusing emotions.]

- [Wider context: Leia has pretty much been out of the Resistance since she
  married Han and got Ben. In fact, she didn't really follow much of the
  details around the formation of the Resistance. Han actually was more
  involved, but also in the periphery. Luke was one of the early participants
  in the Resistance, and did a lot, going on missions, managing people, setting
  policy even, before going on to find and train the new Jedi.]

- [Precision: That doesn't mean Leia merely became a housewife or whatever.
  That really wouldn't work with the character. But, because of various things:
  war-fatigue, her son, Han, and generally wanting to get away from constant
  reminders of all the things related to the conflicts she's been a part ofâ€¦
  she retired from that scene. And the Resistance understood. Some of them did
  just that, too. Leia got involved at a more local level, and I don't mean the
  parent association at Ben's school, although you can bet she was there, too.
  There were many refugees from the wars, there was family (on the Organa side)
  she had to visit, and now that she knew who her biological family was and it
  wasn't wartime, she also tried to find the Amidala family. She helped those
  who needed help. But she kept an almost unconscious distance from anything
  political or connected to the Alliance or the Empire or the Republic.]
