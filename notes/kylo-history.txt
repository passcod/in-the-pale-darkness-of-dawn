Kylo was born in 5 ABY.

He publicly turned to the Dark Side around age 23.

At time of Attack on Tuanul (start of TFA) he was 29.

Kylo wants to destroy the Jedi Order... but not the way Hux and Snoke think of. Kylo believes the Jedi Order was already antiquated at the time of Anakin, and wants to reform it.

Kylo keeps the mangled mask of Darth Vader as a reminder of the failure of the Jedi Order, which let one of its most powerful members become overwhelmed by emotions while being told to ignore them, and prohibited the study of the so-called Dark Side leading to them being defenceless against it when the Sith used it, among other failures he attributes to the Jedi Order.

Kylo learned under Luke, but wanted to learn about all of the Force, not just the limited education of the so-called Light Side. Thus, he allowed himself to be tempted to the Dark Side by Snoke, gaining a mentor in the Dark arts.
