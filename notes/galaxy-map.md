The Galaxy Map is a distributed system where every star and planet and station
and relay and trade route and hyperspace lane is available to everyone as
they're added by anyone, with a few exceptions, mostly things hidden by people
who really don't want to be found or by militaries or other governments. But
generally, all those things are publicly accessible.

What's not is the Overlays: data that provide various proprietary advantages or
information: shipping routes, travel logs, positions of ships in a fleet,
records of economic situations, lists of people known to be somewhere, etc.

Each Overlay is crypted with a Key, and you need the Key to access the Overlay,
but for convenience and updating purposes the Overlays are also part of the
distributed Galaxy Map.

That means that all you need to access the information is a Key, which is
portable and uncomplicated, and can be much more easily destroyed or scrambled
permanently without any chance of recovery in case it's needed. It also means
the Key to an Overlay can be changed.

There's a number of Keys that are in free circulation, there's an entire black
market for stolen or "found" keys, and every pilot, every organisation, big or
small, has their own collection of Keys.

Acquiring Keys is a strategic essential. This is generally Admiral Phasma's
dominion for the First Order, but Master Kylo has his own stash, and the
Knights of Ren also have their own supplemental collections, both obtained
through their missions and forged from their own data.

The Resistance has their own collection, which includes what was recovered from
the Old Republic, plus they have made a bunch more since.

The New Republic was given all the Keys of the Rebellion, minus some
specialised and secret ones, and what was recovered from the Old Republic, as
well as some of the Empire's Keys as defined by treaty. Then they made theirs.

Both of these last two also share some newer ones as they are allied.
