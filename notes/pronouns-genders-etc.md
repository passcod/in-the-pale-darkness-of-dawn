Four pronouns in common usage:

- **he/him/his** - Used mostly by humans and species with a gender binary
- **she/her/her** - Used mostly by humans and species with a gender binary
- **zie/zir/zir** - Used mostly by non-human species with no gender binary
- **they/them/their** - Used by default, for groups, for unknowns, or by
  individuals not on the gender binary

Basic itself has five genders: those four plus the "non-sentient neutral" "it".

Droids are most often **they** in societies that recognise their sentience, and
**it** in societies that don't, but may use other pronouns and identify with a
gender, e.g. BB-8 uses she/her.

While there is heavy humanocentrism in the Empire and its offshoots, it's still
extremist (and a bit surreal to most of the Galalxy) to believe there should
only be two genders. In fact, some of the most common gender extremism is
_non-human_! It comes from xenophobic societies that believe there should be
_no_ gender at all, or only a single gender.

That gender is on a spectrum is common knowledge and has been for millenia.

The current Basic and Aurebesh are simplifications of more ancient forms, which
had even more genders, up to 27 according to historians. Various other
languages have various concepts of gender, although most have at least a
neutral.

Basic (as well as many other languages that have been exposed to space-faring
Basic-speaking civilisations for a long time) has a built-in mechanism for
indicating which gender and pronoun someone uses, as it cannot be inferred.
English has no such mechanism, but genders and pronouns are shown through the
limited third-person view, or through dialogue in some cases.
