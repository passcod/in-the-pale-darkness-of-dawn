A heavy coat is generally called a **parka**. A lighter, less shapey one can be
a **poncho**.

While **fucking** is relatively commonstance, **kriffing** or other
similar-sounding paranyms are much more frequent.

The colloquial language is generally more scientific than ours. Instead of
birds, say **avians**.

All machines are on **repulsors**, but not all machines are **droids** (not
robots, not bots, not artificials). Droids have sentience.

The generic term for people is **sentient beings**. On Empire-controlled worlds,
that's often said as **men** even while the actual makeup of the group may be
mixed; that's because of the Empire's latent human-centrism and subtle sexism.
"Sentient beings" is fairly long, so it is often shortened to **sentients** or
**beings**. Occasionally the alternate term **sapient** is used.

The **Lothal Calendar** is the same in origin as the **Union Calendar**, with a
Year Zero on the Treaty of Coruscant. However, while the Union had precise
synchronised timekeeping because of their important naval industry of the time,
Lothal relied solely on planetary, non-relativistic time for about two millenia,
which ended up skewing the calendar by about four centuries. **3277 LY** is
around the same time as **3652 UY** which is around the same time as **0 ABY**.

The “period when one is/was a **Padawan**” can be called a **Padawancy**.

While a **travel port** is more suited to touristy / urban situations, a **space
port** is the generic term for a facility where spaceships can land, depart, and
generally be catered to.

A **datapad** or **pad** is a rigid tablet generally used to retrieve, hold,
browse, input, or process data. A **datastick** or **stick** is a small memory
hold that can be attached to a datapad or other systems. A **flexipad** is a
rigid enclosure that accepts **flexiplasts**, used for similar purposes but with
less capabilities and more of an emphasis on documents and input than arbitrary
data. A flexiplast, or **plast**, **flexi**, is a soft, flexible, rollable,
foldable, sheet of “smart material” that holds a document. While flexis are
usable on their own, attaching/inserting (depending on the model) to a flexipad
enhances capabilities and enables easier input/transfer as well as more powerful
editing/analysis tools. **Flimsi** is a synonym for **flexi**; usage of one or
the other depends on culture and trend.

A **datatape** may be both a more ancient (by millenia) version of datasticks,
or more currently a highly durable yet cheap archival tool. While a datapad,
datastick, or flexi may hold information for several decades without
interaction, datatapes may keep information safe for centuries, with some
datatapes being several millenia old. Datatapes have an absolute capacity of a
few **exanodes**, but use high density erasure coding to guard against random
corruption by space radiation and age.

Force-users' **holocrons** are also archival tools, improved by their Force
interface, and reinforced by the Force, capable of surviving nearly
indefinitely, with the oldest recorded being around 10,000 years old. However,
they require the Force to be accessed and created, so datatapes are preferred
for general usage.

Datatapes are also highly compatible and cheap to make with standard tools,
although manufacturing the durable versions needs specialised equipment; yet
still none that cannot be found in any manufacturing sector in the Galaxy.

Meals are varied by culture, but for most humans and many cultures following the
humanocentric model, there are three: **breakfast**, **mid-meal**, and
**last-meal**. **Tea** or **caf** may be had at any point day or night, but
while they are often served along with breakfast, it is rarer to see them
consumed for the other two meals.

**Week** and **tenday** are equivalent. A week is ten days in most cultures and
planets around the Galaxy. A **Standard hour** and its subdivisions in minutes
and seconds is a standard duration across the entire Galaxy. However, a **day**
might be shorter or longer depending on the particular planet and its cycles. In
space and hypertravel, a **Galactic Standard Day** is used, modelled around the
Coruscant day of 24 hours. Months are three weeks long. Years are twelve months.
A **tenyear** or **decade** is a period of ten years. A **century** is a period
of a hundred years. A **millenium**, plural millenia, is a thousand years. A
**tenmillenium** is ten thousand years and generally used by historians to mean
the general ten-thousand-years-long period _N_ tenmillenia before current era.

Months within years, weeks within months, days within weeks, and hours within
days do not generally have names, and are instead referred to by their one-based
ordinal index, and sometimes the ordinal and time noun are attached as a single
word, e.g. the fifteenth hour, the third month, the fifth day or fifthday. Weeks
within months are often attached to their months-within-years representation
just to avoid ambiguity, e.g the second week of this month, or the first week of
tenthmonth.

By convention, a single-word time that's not accompanied by distinguishing
context applies to the _next_ occuring period, even if the designation may refer
to the period occuring _right now_. E.g. "tenthday" when said on the fifthday
refers to "five days hence", but "tenthday" when said on a tenthday refers to
"ten days hence".

There are no _aliens_ in the Galaxy. Get that word out of the vocabulary. This
is for a similar reason there are no _extra-terrestrials_. In a Galaxy with tens
of thousands of years of multi-sentient-species cohabitation, the word "alien"
loses its meaning of "not human". Indeed, the most common way to say "alien" in
the Galaxy would be **non-human**, although of course that only makes sense in
some humanocentric contexts.

## Force organisations

**Jedi**, or **The Galactic Order of the Jedi**, a large organisation with many
Temples on many planets, with a long history as independent ambassadors and
Justices of the Peace for the Galaxy, as well as targeted conflict with the
**Sith** organisation. They operate on a strict philosophy of stoicly
controlling their emotions, giving them entirely up to the Force, and only using
the Force by holding themselves within it and letting their actions be guided.
They were almost entirely wiped out during the Galactic Empire. They started
from a Jeda'ii temple on Ossus, and are sometimes called the **Jedi of Ossus**.

**Jeda'ii**, a spiritual group that is the ancestor of the Jedi, started from
origins unknown but probably the planet **Achk-To** or **Jedha** a tenmillenium
ago.

**The Jedaa'i of Idar**, a splinter group of Jedi residing on or around **Idar**
who tried to get back to the Jeda'ii philosophy rather than the Jedi's.

**Guardian of the Whills**, a group of monks mostly residing within the **Holy
City** on Jedha, having mostly a passive relationship to the Force, as well as
serving as spiritual, moral, and moderative guides to the local population. They
were self-designed protectors of **Ancient Temple of the Kyber**, a repository
of knowledge and crystals and, in times past, an access point to the Kyber mines
under the surface of Jedha.

**Shamans of the Whills**, a disparate group of mostly nomadic or hermit
individuals who researched the Force through a lifelong study of their own
connection to it, and made themselves the agents of the Force itself.

**Ancient Order of the Whills**, a name for the perceived consciousness of the
Force used by many societies of Force users around the second tenmillenium BBY.

**Sith** is an organisation of Dark Force users, using their Force connection
exclusively by channeling emotions, often to destructive ends. They are the
self-prescribed and Jedi-prescribed enemies of Light, often trying to enslave
those weaker than them. **Sith** was also an ancient Force-sensitive species
that was enslaved and genetically re-engineered by the precursors of the Sith
organisation.

**Talorta'ii** is a reptilian-avian Force-sensitive species with long lifespans.
While their connection to the Force is guaranteed by their biology, they make
use of it naturally, and rarely consciously. Their presence in the Force is an
extremely private matter in their culture, and they do not train it and often do
not even acknowledge it to others, including members of their own family. Their
homeworld seceded from the so-called Known Galaxy around the Treaty of Coruscant
but they chose to isolate themselves completely instead of joining with other
seceded parties. Knowledge about them remains from archives.

The **Witches of Dathomir**, also known as **Nightsisters** and
**Nightbrothers**, a highly hierarchic dual society, completely segregated by
binary gender, operating mostly around emotional Force connections on the planet
**Dathomir**. They held themselves independent in the Jedi-Sith conflicts, but
not neutral.

**The Baran Do Sages**.

**The Paladins**.

**The Walker families**.

**Isde Naha Clan of the First Light**, one of the many nomadic clans of Isde
Naha. Unlike the **Clan of the Toribota**, they are Force-sensitive. Both clans
(and many others from Isde Naha) look for the system of the "First Light", the
first star glimpsed by their ancestors. The Isde Naha archives indicate that
around that star the ancient Naha people felt a very strong Force presence that
prompted them to develop space travel.

**The Beatific Siblings**.
