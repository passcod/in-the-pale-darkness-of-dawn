A heavy coat is generally called a **parka**.

While **fucking** is relatively commonstance, **kriffing** or other
similar-sounding paranyms are much more frequent.

The colloquial language is generally more scientific than ours. Instead of
birds, say **avians**.

All machines are on **repulsors**, but not all machines are **droids** (not
robots, not bots, not artificials). Droids have sentience.

The generic term for people is **sentient beings**. On Empire-controlled worlds,
that's often said as **men** even while the actual makeup of the group may be
mixed; that's because of the Empire's latent human-centrism and subtle sexism.
"Sentient beings" is fairly long, so it is often shortened to **sentients** or
**beings**. Occasionally the alternate term **sapient** is used.

The **Lothal Calendar** is the same in origin as the **Union Calendar**, with a
Year Zero on the Treaty of Coruscant. However, while the Union had precise
synchronised timekeeping because of their important naval industry of the time,
Lothal relied solely on planetary, non-relativistic time for about two millenia,
which ended up skewing the calendar by about four centuries. **3277 LY** is
around the same time as **3652 UY** which is around the same time as **0 ABY**.

The “period when one is/was a **Padawan**” can be called a **Padawancy**.

While a **travel port** is more suited to touristy / urban situations, a **space
port** is the generic term for a facility where spaceships can land, depart, and
generally be catered to.

A **datapad** or **pad** is a rigid tablet generally used to retrieve, hold,
browse, input, or process data. A **datastick** or **stick** is a small memory
hold that can be attached to a datapad or other systems. A **flexipad** is a
rigid enclosure that accepts **flexiplasts**, used for similar purposes but with
less capabilities and more of an emphasis on documents and input than arbitrary
data. A flexiplast, or **plast**, **flexi**, is a soft, flexible, rollable,
foldable, sheet of “smart material” that holds a document. While flexis are
usable on their own, attaching/inserting (depending on the model) to a flexipad
enhances capabilities and enables easier input/transfer as well as more powerful
editing/analysis tools. **Flimsi** is a synonym for **flexi**; usage of one or
the other depends on culture and trend.

A **datatape** may be both a more ancient (by millenia) version of datasticks,
or more currently a highly durable yet cheap archival tool. While a datapad,
datastick, or flexi may hold information for several decades without
interaction, datatapes may keep information safe for centuries, with some
datatapes being several millenia old. Datatapes have an absolute capacity of a
few **exanodes**, but use high density erasure coding to guard against random
corruption by space radiation and age.

Force-users' **holocrons** are also archival tools, improved by their Force
interface, and reinforced by the Force, capable of surviving nearly
indefinitely, with the oldest recorded being around 10,000 years old. However,
they require the Force to be accessed and created, so datatapes are preferred
for general usage.

Datatapes are also highly compatible and cheap to make with standard tools,
although manufacturing the durable versions needs specialised equipment; yet
still none that cannot be found in any manufacturing sector in the Galaxy.

Meals are varied by culture, but for most humans and many cultures following the
humanocentric model, there are three: **breakfast**, **mid-meal**, and
**last-meal**. **Tea** or **caf** may be had at any point day or night, but
while they are often served along with breakfast, it is rarer to see them
consumed for the other two meals.
