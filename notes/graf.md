Maybe have a look at the resolution of the adventures of the Graf family, see
if we can do something with that. Either Kylo liberating Graf-World from the
Imperial Archives and using it as a secret base, especially after the Schism,
or the Resistance eventually getting them to safety and getting their Overlay
data plus cartographer skills. Maybe both.
