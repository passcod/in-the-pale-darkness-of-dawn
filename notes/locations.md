## Thabeska

The small (2000 km diameter, ~6 times smaller than Coruscant) planet is not
canonically located more precisely than "Outer Rim", so for this fic I put it
in the Cadma sector.

The planet has a temperate-dry climate with very little surface water, which
makes it mostly dusty, but it's not a sandy desert planet like Tatooine.

About 20% of its surface is more or less urbanised. It has a modest population
of five million beings. Most settlements are within walking distance of one
another. The capital city is also the only large city, and counts about 2
million people within its official borders.
