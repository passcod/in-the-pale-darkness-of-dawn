Instead of having a techie explain the galaxy map as a plot fob, have Kylo and
Phasma explain it to Hux, while they're having discussions on how to proceed.
Hux can make his own inferences and guesses, feeding them back into the
conversation â€” sometime he'll be incorrect, but then his two co-commanders can
correct him.

That will create a compelling dialogue that actually has reason to happen, and
provide ample opportunity to both display the intelligence of all three
members, as well as various quips and tone and piques and other rhethoric to
show Kylo and Phasma bonding, to show that Kylo doesn't like Hux much, that Hux
thinks there is a rivality between them, but Kylo actually despises Hux. Also
hint that Kylo is ambivalent about Phasma. Hint that both Kylo and Phasma are
disapproving about Hux's tendency for cruelty and senseless violence ("Fear
does not work well to secure loyalty, if you'll remember the last, oh, fifteen
or so betrayals you've suffered.") but have Hux come back and feel secure in
his position.

Place that explainer as only a part of the wider discussion. Have it be Hux
stating a goal, then Kylo suggesting a way to get there, but Phasma countering
with e.g. "No, that wouldn't work because of [three-word technical detail]."
and then Kylo aquiesces, **but Hux expresses confusion**. And then Kylo
establishes that Hux doesn't know how the Galaxy Map works, and instead is
operating under the simplified understanding that most people have (and that
the films show).
