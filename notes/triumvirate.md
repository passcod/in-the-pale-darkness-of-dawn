Phasma is an Admiral, not merely a Captain, and properly part of the commanding
triumvirate with General Hux and Master Kylo, but she's still called Captain.
Her title is Admiral, but she's attached to being a Captain. This is also when
her reputation was made, and soldiers serving under/with her call her Captain.

She's also Captain of her ship, regardless of her command of entire fleets.

Hux is responsible for the SKB, all ground troops and strategy, and a First
Order fanatic. Kylo is responsible for the Knights of Ren, special and
precision missions, and answers to the Force. Phasma is responsible for ships
and logistics, the Navy part of the military, and prides herself on exactitude
and ultimate performance.
