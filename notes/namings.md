Namings (with an uppercase) existed in the Knights before Ben Organa got Named
Kylo. Now a Master of the Knights, he doesn't mind. He understands the
tradition, having been part of the group for a while. And it reminds him of
stories of his grandfather from before he was Vader, of the clones and the
Names they took for themselves.

The Knights don't have a monopoly on Namings. Kylo doesn't know that when he
thinks of those stories, he is closer to the truth than he ever thought. They
are a tradition started with the clone army of old, kept and brought forward
through the entire Empire's (and now First Order's) existence, in the
underground of the army, in the hidden depths of the navy. Hux discourages the
practice. Kylo obviously doesn't. Phasma quietly (but secretly) encourages it.

The ceremony the Knights use is the evolution of a variant of a Mando'a
tradition, applied to younglings who become ready to be trained more formally
in combat. Other units have slightly different ceremonies, often accounting for
the need for secrecy and to be able to hold them in any place, ship, or even
while moving.
