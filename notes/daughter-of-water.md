# Daughter of Water

Tales/myth about the Old Fardi, centered around the Daughter of Water (named
Watilda, but rarely referred to like that), a Heir of the Family. The events
that inspired the stories transpired on Thabeska, back when it was a lush and
fertile planet rather than a sandy desert.

At least one of the tales speaks of the Daughter's meeting, getting-to-know,
and subsequent companionship with a commoner's daughter (named Etra Ri, then
Etra Fardi, sometimes called Daughter of the Earth).

The stories often show the Daughter being relentlessly generous and fair, as
well as her Family. Some tales for older children, that Naema hasn't heard, but
that Hedala has overheard, speak of the Lady of Water, when the Daughter became
Family Head. Still fair, still generous, but with more political roles and
intrigues. A strong leader rather than a young Heir.

The story of Naema and Hedala reflects some of the stories of the Daughter of
Water and her partner, except they don't happen on Thabeska, this time round.
This is the Star Wars theme: the stories ever repeating throughout the Galaxy.

## Names

In Thabeskan, "Fardi" means "family". "Fardi family" is therefore like "curry
meal" or "Lemba bread". But foreign linguistics aside, the Fardi Clan is
literally the living representatives of Thabeskans. They are Thabeska's own
Family. The Fardi Clan Head loses their first name and is simply "Fardi" or
"the Fardi", the living personification of the very concept of family to
Thabeskans (or at least those who respect the old traditions/culture).

No two living Fardi Clan members share the same first name, because it is their
_only_ name, and some important Fardi first names are not re-used even after
their death. There is also a convention of letting some time pass before
re-using the name, often a generation, or 20 years.

When marrying, it is the choice of the partners whether to become Fardi. They
may do so on the occasion of the marriage, or later on. However, becoming Fardi
is irreversible, even if the partners separate afterwards. Becoming Fardi
doesn't necessarily affect their name. Inversely, a marrying Fardi cannot
become non-Fardi, but can change their name to match their partner's.

While inter-Fardi marriage is allowed, it is subject to Second Republic rules
of consanguinity among Human and Human-adjacent species, which limits
reproductive marriage to at least three levels of consanguinity, and
non-reproductive sexual marriage to at least two. In practice, inter-Fardi
marriage is rare in the Clan Core, and unusual elsewhere.

## Fardi jurisdictions

Fardi have their own internal structures, including a judicial system. In
history, whether that system was compliant with the Thabeskan system has
varied. Under the Third Republic, it was. Under the Empire, it was not.

While Fardi play an important role in Thabeska, and at some points have been
the government, for the past few centuries under the Third Republic they have
been an informal party to a democratic government instead. Under the Empire,
they are a not part of government at all, although they remain privileged.
Under the Fourth Republic, they formed their own government again after
overthrowing the local Imperial presence. Just like under the Third, they may
transition to a democracy after peace has stabilised.

## Children of Thabeska

For some reason, perhaps because of the lack of tech at the time, perhaps
because of tradition or morals, or perhaps because that's what the tales
needed, and it wasn't actually true... but nonetheless, Watilda and Etra didn't
have biological children of their own. But they were Fardi. They were the
family of Thabeska. And Thabeska was their family. Their children were the
children of Thabeska.

## Following the water throughout the ages

In the Naming Tale of the Daughter of Water, the tale that gave her the name,
Watilda becomes lost in the wild, then, when it gets dark and she gets hungry
and thirst and homesick, listens to forest, listens to the wild, and hears the
sound of water. She follows the sound to its source, and finds a small stream,
that she then follows, downstream, out of the jungle and to a village. She
knocks on a door and is welcomed into a home as if she was a child of that
family, because she is, she is Fardi, she is Family.

Now, the second part of the tale is about that idea of Fardi and family, and
that stayed the same, and kept the same meaning throughout. But the first part
changed meaning as Thabeska itself changed.

When Thabeska was a forested planet, lush and green, the tale was practical.
Told to children so they remember: if lost in a forest, stay calm, listen, find
the sound of water, find a stream, follow it downstream, and you'll find
civilisation (and from there, your way home).

But now Thabeska is a desert planet. And the tale is told to remind people that
under the sand there is water, and that if you can listen deeply, you can hear
it, far beneath the surface, and if you can listen, the sound of water will
guide you in life. It is told to small children to teach them calm and
patience. It is reminded as one gets older as the guiding principle of the
desert: stay calm (panicking uses more of your own water and breath), stay
quiet (noise attracts predators and can cause sand tremors), listen carefully,
follow carried-over noises to safety. The sound of sand and wind hitting a
cliff face, for example, or the sounds of a city or village.

And metaphorically, the water really is the Force, the sound is its Voice,
guiding all life along the right path, so long as you are willing to listen.
