Hux wants to destroy the Capital Worlds, but this interferes with Kylo's plans. Given that Hux's goals include the destruction of the Jedi, Kylo thinks he may be able to influence Hux **not** to destroy the capital worlds if this would help kill the Jedi faster.

Kylo thinks that the key to Luke's position on the galactic map may have a good chance to be located on the capital worlds. Thus, destroying the worlds before finding the key would significantly slow down the search for Luke.

Nevertheless, Kylo knows that Hux will never be convinced by thoughts and conjectures, so he orders a series of simulations done to estimate:

- Whether the key is likely to be within the capital worlds (given to workgroup PK-8491), and
- How long it would take to crack the key by brute-force (given to workgroup PK-9135).

  + Several angles of attack: the obvious first solution is to visit all systems and planets, but a) that's already underway, b) the target is probably in an unexplored region so they'd need to do _thorough_ deep space exploration, which is even harder, and c) detection would require a Force-sensitive, and none of those eligible are both trustworthy to the First Order, trained, _and_ may be spared from other assignments.

  + Another angle is to attack the overlay, instead of brute-forcing the key. Technically, the protection on overlays is crackable faster than forcing the key, mostly because of compatibility as older ships and therefore older navicomps need to be able to access the data. But the issue here is that there's no way to know the contents or even the rough area of an overlay unless it's encrypted, and there are literally thousands of overlays they don't have a key for.

  + Finally, brute-forcing the key itself is impractical given the little information they have. Even with all the metadata they'd need, the worst case upper time limit on the key search is about 80 years, accounting for optimistic computing advances. With only the metadata they have, it rises to at least a 300 years. Both estimates are obviously unnacceptable.

  + In other words, the attack is unfeasible. That's both good and bad news: bad because obviously they'd have wanted to get access to the Overlay, but good because it confirms that even with government-level resources, the Galaxy Map is still safe and secure, and by extension the plans and logistics of the First Order are safe from other players.

**This is where the fic starts.**

Kylo receives both reports and sends his conclusions. He also opens communications with Phasma to pass on the 'good news' part of the last report as that's in her interests. Taking advantage of the open link, Phasma gives her confirmation for Kylo's travel plans to take his Shuttle and Resurgent-class Battlecruiser (named _Finalizer_, the one we see above Jakku in TFA!) to Morellia stealthily. She closes by saying she'll have her people send the details to Kylo's people.

(This affirms both Kylo's and Phasma's positions in this fic as big wigs who have a staff and large amounts of people under their command, it provides a dialogue opportunity in an official capacity between the two so we can really hammer Phasma's title of Admiral, it hints that Phasma will not be anywhere near Jakku — why would she as an Admiral — which means Kylo has greater operational freedom, and finally it gives a good transition opportunity for the next plot point: the mission with the Knights of Ren.)

Meanwhile, he carries out training with the Knights of Ren, and takes them on a short recon mission on a world where intelligence placed a small covert Resistance presence: Morellia. A secondary objective is to possibly find traces of Wild Space map data possibly left by the Graf family.

While there, Kylo receives a transmission that seems to originate from the dead planet Malachor. **and leave it at that**

(Malachor is where Tano was last seen, but don't say that in the text. The entire Tano presence is a very lightly evoked "extra plot" that may be explored in a sequel, or is just a hint/homage for savvy readers otherwise.)

The triumvirate meets to discuss the information and decide on further action.

Hux is unmoved from his conviction, as he indicates that he has received intelligence that the key might be in the hands of Lor San Tekka, whom Admiral Phasma traced to Jakku.

Kylo volunteers to go investigate, presumably so that Hux may remain on Starkiller Base to oversee final preparations, and be ready to execute the destruction of the capital worlds as soon as word of the recovery of the key comes back.

Phasma will move the First Order navy in anticipation of either the destruction of the capital worlds and monitoring that plus destroying any remnants, or the infiltration of the worlds in search of the Key if word comes back to that effect.

Kylo, on his side, prepares several of his plans:

- He leaves several platoons on Starkiller Base with orders to stay at critical places (the cooling plant, the weapon's firing mechanisms, the communication center, the shield generator), ready to disable SKB if necessary.

- He leaves with them emergency orders to disable SKB if it starts to be powered on and targeted before he comes back.

**At this point he actually starts for Jakku.**

- He prepares for his schism from the First Order.

- He directs his fleet to subtly start moving towards neutral territory, and to prepare to drop identifications and disguise themselves as much as possible.

- He sends a message to Ahsoka Tano, telling her he's beginning to move. [See: snippets/message-to-tano.md]

**After arriving on Jakku, but before going for Tekka.**

- He prepares for his escape from the Knights of Ren, becoming simply "Kylo", and not "Kylo Ren".

**See notes/broad-strokes.txt for what happens around this.**

San Tekka is found and Kylo interrogates him, far more gently than San Tekka expects. Kylo finds that the key is contained within Luke's lightsaber. He relays this information to Hux, believing that the most likely place for the lightsaber is within the capital worlds. However, Hux believes that if it was, they would say so publicly, as the lightsaber is a huge symbol, so he orders the strike.

As soon as Kylo learns of the decision, he triggers some of his plans.

Kylo debarks a smaller shuttle, and orders his command shuttle along with his advisors, crew, staff, and troops to go back to SKB and help the forces he left there to stop the strike, cripple the Base if possible, and engage schism protocols.

He hides from the Knights of Ren so they remain on board the command shuttle, believing him to be there too, while he stays on Jakku with his smaller shuttle until the Knights and other First Order presence is far enough away that he can move.

Finn is directed by a rebel faction (Finn's unit was trained directly under Admiral Phasma for a time) within Kylo's forces to stay on Jakku to spy on Kylo. However, Finn is loyal to Kylo first, and to the First Order only through Kylo's perceived loyalty to the First Order. Kylo is responsible for the changes to stormtrooper culture, and Finn is grateful that they do not have to kill any more innocents, as they did several times prior to being moved to Kylo's troops.

Kylo decides to seek out the Force-sensitive he detected while meeting with Lor San Tekka, while worrying about how his plans are going.

Finn is following Kylo, and going through their own identity crisis as they learn more about Kylo while he goes about behaving very differently from the image he projected while a part of the First Order.

Rey is still a scavenger, but now has the companionship of BB-8.

Poe searches for BB-8 and is in communication with the Resistance.
