Phasma is an Admiral, not merely a Captain, and properly part of the commanding triumvirate with General Hux and Master Kylo.

Hux is responsible for the SKB, all ground troops and strategy, and a First Order fanatic. Kylo is responsible for the Knights of Ren, special and precision missions, and answers to the Force. Phasma is responsible for ships and logistics, the Navy part of the military, and prides herself on exactitude and ultimate performance.
