So, pre-TFA and pre-First-Order, you have the Galactic Empire. The Empire was
created from the old Republic from a political coup, essentially. From that,
and from the behaviour of the Empire, a Resistance started up. So the
Resistance is made of three different kinds of people: those who were in the
Old Republic and got ousted by the Empire+coup, those who got fucked by / are
unhappy with / are oppressed by the Empire, and those who grew up in the
Resistance. The second category is interesting, because it's both the largest
one, and it's made of people who've had their trust in government broken.

And that means that even when the Rebellion kinda triumphed over the Empire and
sent its leadership packing, and the Newer Republic started up, those people
didn't suddenly rejoice and start trusting a new government. So the Rebellion
renamed itself the Resistance and didn't disband, because a lot of its members
like having their own faction, and there's an undercurrent of maybe-distrust
towards the Republic, and they don't want to "move" there, and they also don't
want Resistance worlds to now become Republic worlds.

More than that, the Resistance has *public recognition* as being, basically,
mostly on the side of the little people. A bit like the Jedi originally were,
before they got fucked by Palpatine. (That's why Rey, a no-name scavenger on a
backwater desertic planet, knew about the Resistance and immediately trusted
one of their agents, but thought the Jedi were a myth.) The Republic doesn't
yet have that reputation. Heck, the Republic immediately positioned itself
*against the Empire*...and its remnants... which doesn't help *at all* the
people on those remnants... like, guess who, Rey.

While the Resistance is about resisting and liberating *all people*, the
Republic is mostly about restoring a democracy and establishing a good and
solid government for *its people*.

Thus, not only does the Resistance remain, but it is a distinct and relevant
faction in the Galaxy. The Resistance in canon is a military organisation. The
Resistance in Master Kylo has a civilian government branch, although it is
subbordinate to the military one. Leia Organa took over as leader after Mon
Mothma founded the New Republic. She was never "disgraced" from the NR Senate,
and the NR Senate doesn't "tolerate" the Resistance — or at least, they tell
themselves they do and that it remains there because they permit it, but really
the Resistance is a *ally* of the New Republic, and the New Republic can't
really afford to piss it off for no reason.

The Republic is the traditional civilian government with a military branch.

The First Order (in Master Kylo) has three independent military branches (an
army commanded by Hux, a navy ordered by Phasma, and intelligence headed by
Kylo) and two civilian governments (the Empire that manages the Empire remnants
in the "known" universe, and the First Order Governance that manages the First
Order controlled worlds in the "Unknown" Regions). All five of these are
subbordinate to Supreme Leader Snoke. The three military leaders are known as
the Triumvirate, and the Triumvirate plus the civilian leadership plus Snoke is
named the High Command.

Another interesting difference in Master Kylo is that all three of these
factions have legislative and judiciary branches. In the First Order, each of
the five main branches have their own judiciary, and leaders are exempt. In the
Resistance, the judiciary is a separate branch that looks upon both the
civilian and military branches, and leaders are *not* exempt (although there's
protections to avoid internal coups, and also leaders are generally very
popular so it's hard to remove them... but they can still be punished in other
ways). The Resistance also has a legislative arm, which took the Rebellion's
Declaration:

> We, the Rebel Alliance, do therefore in the name — and by the authority — of
> the free beings of the Galaxy, solemnly publish and declare our intentions:
>
> To fight and oppose you and your forces, by any and all means at our
> disposal; To refuse any Imperial law contrary to the rights of free beings;
> To bring about your destruction and the destruction of the Galactic Empire;
> To make forever free all beings in the galaxy. To these ends, we pledge our
> property, our honor, and our lives.

and derived from it a Constitution and from there, a body of laws.

> We, free beings of the Galaxy, establish a Resistance and declare our
> commitment: To fight against tyrannies large and small, yesterday, today, and
> tomorrow; To refuse any law contrary to the inalienable rights of all free
> beings; To make forever free all beings in the Galaxy; To protect and
> safeguard them and their welfare; To resist in and out of our worlds against
> all those who would seek to mistreat, to enslave, to corrupt, to destroy.

Aside from those three, which are known as "The Big Three" outside of them,
there's smaller governments: the Hutt Clan, various Pirate organisations, the
Nal Raka criminal empire, Nar Shaddaa, the Corporate Sector, and various
independents.
