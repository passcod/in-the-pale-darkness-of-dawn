In this fic, the conditions necessary for SW:TFA to begin never occur:

- Kylo has established measures for stormtroopers and staff under his command
  that improve work and living conditions, as well as loyalty and earned
  respect. Thus, Finn (UID FN-2187) is content with his station and doesn't
  desert.

- Kylo doesn't believe in unnecessary death, so he never orders the killing of
  civilians during the Attack on Tuanul. In fact, none of the attackers have
  the authorisation to set their blasters higher than stun, and all have orders
  to keep confrontation to a minimum.

- Kylo doesn't kill Lor San Tekka after questioning him.

- Poe doesn't engage Kylo's forces, as he is trying to approach Lor San Tekka,
  and the forces aren't being violent, so there is little need for him to be
  senselessly captured and injured, and even less need to present the
  Resistance in a bad light by creating a confrontation within a civilian area
  without just cause.

However, there are events still going on:

- BB-8 and Poe are separated during the initial panic when Kylo arrives to
  Tuanul (sure, Kylo is *known* for the above, but at the same time it's not
  really easy for random civilians to recognise which of the triumvirate a
  particular shuttle belongs to, at a glance). BB-8 finds Rey, recognises her
  as being Force-sensitive, and decides to stay around her as that's a better
  chance to be led to the Resistance, or at least to follow in the guidance of
  the Force.

- Rey witnesses the interaction between Kylo and Lor San Tekka, and is shocked
  to learn that the Jedi are real. Kylo detects a Force-sensitive, sees Rey and
  thinks he might recognise her, but doesn't know from where. Using a passive
  Force Scan, he gleans from her thoughts her pitiful existence as a scavenger
  on Jakku. He is briefly tempted to approach her and remove her from poverty,
  but the Force pushes him to ignore this.

- Poe searches for BB-8 but cannot find it. After Kylo (seemingly) departs from
  Jakku, he contacts the Resistance and asks for help to recover BB-8.

Moreover, the New Republic capital worlds are not destroyed by Starkiller Base.
