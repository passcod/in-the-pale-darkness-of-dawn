# In the Pale Darkness of Dawn

A Star Wars: The Force Awakens fanfic.

Story is in five threads:

## Saka

A young human girl in an entire Union of systems that separated from the Known
Regions (here called the Rim worlds) just after the Treaty of Coruscant, and
only learns of happenings there when Rim expeditions lose themselves (or, more
rarely, deliberately try to go) beyond the violent plasma winds that border the
Unknown Regions. She grows up in a relatively peaceful yet somewhat changing
time, after an expedition of the early Empire (using the _Mandator_ capital
ship) try to invade a Union capital world, _Unteli_, in their typical fashion.
After a short conflict, compromises are made, trade is opened, and immigration
(from the capital ship's crew) begins.

When the _Eclipse_ arrives in the system, following a secret Force signal
Sidious had placed on the original _Mandator_, they are directed to a moon that
was granted for the Empire's use. From there, they start building up their army
and their fleets in anticipation of returning to the Rim for another round of
Imperial warring. 

Saka is a teenager chaffing, like her mother before her, at the confines of
their home system. Her mother had no opportunities to escape beyond a service
in _Unteli_'s first military and then community corps, after which she fell in
love with a former Empire immigrant and settled. Saka, though, now has a
choice: either the safe option, to serve _Unteli_ (or another of the Union
worlds), or the much more dangerous option, to enlist with the fledging First
Order and have the chance to travel beyond the Union, and see the Rim.

Unnerved by her father's stories and hints of Empire warfare and losses, she
has no interest in staying a low-grade officer and die prematurely. So while
she abhors the xenophobic and purity politics the First Order prophesses, she
aims for the top, steels herself, trains hard, affects a mask of ruthlessness,
and lies through her teeth to reach as high a command as she can get. In a
male-dominated and actively hostile society and military, that's no easy goal.

To protect her family from any repercussion she might engender, she chooses a
false name before posting her candidature for immigration to the First Order
moon: Phasma.

## Firefin

## Rey

## The Resistance

From various points of view, the story of a stronger, more independent
Resistance. Initially without Leia, but she joins later on.

In this fic, the non-Republic aspects of the Rebellion didn't forget about:

- the Republic being corrupted and allowing the rise of Palpatine;

- the Republic kinda ignoring injustices so long as they occurred outside of
  its worlds;

- the Republic's less-than-stellar attitude towards tolerating slaver trade and
  worlds where it happened, as well as non-obvious slavery;

- the Republic's Senate being this huge clusterfuck, that the New Republic
  brought back verbatim, even re-seating some of the very same people who'd
  been there since before the Empire;

- the lack of the Jedi as an interplanetary peace-keeping force;

- the Empire still being around;

- the worlds they hailed from still being oppressed.

Notably, the Lothal resistance, the millions of female Twi'lek still sexually
enslaved around the Galaxy, Mandalore, Raada, Jakku, Tatooine, etc. Nar Shadaa
and the Hutt empire. All those worlds perpetuating misery and suffering.

When the Alliance disbanded and the delegation of the two thousand, plus a
large part of the Resistance High Command, departed to form the New Republic,
the rest of the Rebellion didn't follow. They quietly stayed organised,
watching the New Republic in hope and bated breath, waiting to see if the New
Republic succeeded and would thus be able to help them free their worlds.

And then there was an assassination attempt on Mon Mothma. And the Senate
refused to send help to a distressed ally under invasion, the Wookies of
Kashyyyk. So they stood up, and said enough. They formed a new faction, called
themselves The Resistance For All Beings, or simply the Resistance for short,
and organised both a military branch and a civilian branch. Sullust, Gatalenta,
Lonera, and a few other worlds immediately backed them.

Within 15 years, they had liberated, fought for, or aided more than 50 planets,
offering choice (not only joining them, but also going independent or even
joining any of the other free groups, including the New Republic) every time. Other worlds voluntarily joined them, some entire federations or alliances or other such groups of systems merged with them, etc.

When Leia came out of self-imposed retirement (after fighting wars her entire
life, and then watching the New Republic repeat the same mistake, she'd done
away from being directly involved with politics for a while) in 21-22 ABY, the
Resistance counted 112 worlds, 98 of which were economic members, and 79 who
had representatives on the governmental body [TK: Chamber? Parliament?
Council?]. At TFA#End (around 34-35 ABY), membership was upwards of 170 worlds.

The fic follows various people at various times when they had a significant (in
terms of plot and story) influence on the development and continued existence
of the Resistance. Among them:

- Lor San (he), a Force-believer who mostly spends time around Luke's New Jedi
- Col Dorr (she), a Representative in the Resistance's government
- Alseen (zie/zir), another Rep
- Digla (they), a Mon Calamari ship technician
- Lando (he), a high-ranked administrator in the Interplanetary Corps
- Jessika (she), a pilot in the Resistance navy
- Poe (he), a pilot at first, and then a commander in the Resistance navy
- Leia (she), at first in Interplanetary Corps, then in Military command
- Vitchum (zie/zir), an IC world rehabilitation technician/strategist
- Joph Seastriker (he), [TK: see wiki]
- Zavi Bangel (she), [TK: see wiki]
- possibly others, TBD
