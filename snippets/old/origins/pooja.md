It wasn't often nowadays that Pooja Naberrie was nervous.

As a child under the Republic, she occasionally had to pretend Aunt Padmé
wasn't married, when speaking to the Jedi who would sometimes accompany her
mother on diplomatic visits. She was nervous then, but she was a child.

As a child under the Empire, she always had to pretend, and she had to say she
hated the Jedi traitors to the other kids at school, because you never knew who
was listening. She said it so often she almost started to believe it, but she
could confer with her sister in the attic and sometimes (sometimes!) with her
mother as well. They would tell stories of Aunt Padmé and Uncle Ani and others
from Before. She was still seen as a child then, but she wasn't, and she
stopped being nervous, too.

As a teenager under the Empire, she'd gotten involved in the Senate, which
alone was maze of interactions and plots and inflences, but this was not just
the Senate, it was the Imperial Senate, with the unpredictable moods of the
Emperor and his dark henchman, the constant surveillance. On top of that was
her participations in the Rebellion and the whole mess of codes and hidden words
and conversations; those hushed, those out in the open but where everything
meant something else, those you weren't quite sure were meant to be covert or
just innocent between peers.

She met less often with her sister, but they were both in with the Resistance.
Wanting to help, in honour of Aunt Padmé, was the entire reason they both were.
Their mother knew, she was sure, but wasn't certain, so she never said it. She
convinced herself it was safer that way.

Only a few years later she'd received the signal to evacuate, and then the
Senate was no more, culled, replaced by the moffs. Many senators disappeared,
but whether that was because they went into hiding or something more sinister,
she often didn't know.

What followed was a deadly game of cat and mouse, but unlike in the Senate she
never got to see the cat, and they were many mice together. Not only Pooja and
Ryoo and her family, but a dozen other families as well. They moved from safe
planet to safe planet, sometimes to unsafe planets as well, to asteroids, to
ghost ships drifting through, to busy bases or ones left empty.

All the while the Rebellion became the Alliance, and declared they would Restore
the Republic, and fought and eventually won. Pooja didn't really much care about
the Republic. She cared about being free, and not having to run anymore, and
being able to tell the stories of her Aunt and Uncle and old friends without
having to be scared. She cared about the safety of her friends, and about Naboo.

When the New Republic rose from the ashes of the Empire, she felt hope. When it
re-established much of its old ways, that was dimmed a bit. When Naboo was not
liberated, when it was left to "liberate itself", she laughed and turned away.

She needed something new, and she'd heard rumours.
