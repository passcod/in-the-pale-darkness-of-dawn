Darth Huun was curious.

While visitors to the monument containing his tomb were not infrequent, they
did not tend to stay for long. In death, time was difficult to gauge, and he
mostly felt visitors by the wafts of Force they left in their wake, after the
initial surge of their presence woke him up. He had taken naps only to realise
he had drifted off for decades, although his fellow dead Sith tended not to
diverge much in their conversation topics.

Without a body, without means to record or access the outside world, talking
was all they could do... and yet, they could not discuss much more than old
philosophical riddles. Huun hoped philosophers out in the galaxy had long moved
past the Starfighter problem, but if they hadn't, they could come to Malachor!
Sith ghosts had been discussing all angles of the problem several times over
for centuries.

This visitor had arrived with others after days of the Force being a little
more chaotic than usual. Most of the dead Sith had awaken, and the halls had
once again been busy as ghosts murmured theories and wild guesses as to what
had caused the latest Force turmoil. The betting pool had been going strong.
(Huun's shade darkened slightly as he thought of Andeddu prancing about after
winning all through his _ridiculous_ hypothesis that _barely_ (but just enough)
matched what they had witnessed.)

But the visitors then left... all but one, shrouded in grief, retreating deeper
into the monument. Huun had thought that one would either die, as had many
others left stranded on the dead planet, or Fall. But they had done neither.
