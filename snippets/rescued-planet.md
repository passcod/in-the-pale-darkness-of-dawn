"We've gotten pretty good at rehabilitating planets," zie said a smile. "Even
at first when we were just starting out we had the guidelines from how the
Alliance used to do things. Those weren't bad, even though they were more
adapted to blockaded, invaded worlds. This isn't quite that, but the Empire —
or its remnants — haven't actually varied their methods much."

"So you have a formula, that you always apply?" [TK: charname] frowned.

"Fuck no. That wouldn't work. We have a roadmap, with many components, but it's
not linear, there's not a single path. That and we do continue to amend it, of
course. We start by cursory investigation, as fast as possible, often before we
even entertain notions of liberating the world itself. There's entire files
with details on Ryloth, on Lothal… for when we get there."

"When? Not if?"

"No. We'll get there," something flashed in zir eyes, then the expression
morphed to absolute certainty before zie continued. "Anyway, we investigate and
that lets us situate the world on the roadmap. We just mark all the components
that are already there, and discard those that aren't needed, and then we work
to fill the rest up til the world can stand by itself and can follow the rest
of the journey to completion. Once we've got boots on surface and beings in
offices we can figure out more detail and adjust."

"So it's always different, but you're not flying off the seat of your pants
every time. That's, well, more than I expected. Although I'm not sure what I
expected. But it wasn't that." [TK: pronoun] paused. "I'm glad."
