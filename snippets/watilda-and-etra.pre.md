Once upon a time a little girl was playing in the wild
one day she heard a noise, and saw an animal, and it interested her
she did not consider the danger, for she was family of all that live on the
land, and so nothing could harm her
she simply approached the animal slowly, careful only not to startle it
it has fur and antlers and it was looking at the ground, looking for food
it was a bit higher than she was, but she was family of all that live on the
land, and she was not afriad
when it saw her approaching, it looked up and considered her.
she smiled but was careful not to bare her teeth
she stood confidently but loosely
she thought only peace and calm
it must have understood, because it turned away and set itself back to its task
when she was right near to it, she reached out timidly and stroke its fur
it did not leave, and she grew bolder, but ever respectful
when it had exhausted all that there was to eat in this small patch of dirt
it moved away a little, and the little girl followed
and so it went, on and on, for the most part of a morning
the sun was high but the clouds were many, and the light filtering from above
was uniform
so the little girl did not notice when, while following the animal, she was led
into the jungle
deeper and deeper into the jungle she went, absorbed as she was in caring and
petting the gracious animal
but suddenly there was a noise, a noise too loud and too strange for the animal
to ignore, and with a jump it fled away
the little girl now looked around, and saw she was nowhere she knew
there was jungle as far as she could see
jungle forward
jungle back
jungle right
jungle left
jungle above
and even jungle below
she was lost
she did not know how to read the jungle
she could not see through the jungle
she could not remember where she had come from
and they, the animal and her, had taking many a turn to get here
the animal was long gone, and she could not see another like it
but she could not remain in place
so she started walking in a direction
using what little skylight she could see to guide herself
so as not to go round and round in circles
she did not speak, and did not yell,
for she knew, somehow, none would hear her that would be friendly
but she opened her senses, her eyes, her ears
and she walked forward with a good step
when she started hearing murmurs
she stopped and looked around
but she could not see where they could come from
so she continued walking forward
it was as if the jungle itself was talking
guiding her onwards, guiding her out, she hoped
when she had walked for what seemed hours,
and the shadows were starting to lengthen,
she almost despaired
but another murmured chant made it to her ears
a clear and tingling sound, not too far, not too close
she altered her course to meet it
the soft and slow murmur of the jungle soothing her fears
she reached a gulley, and knew she was saved
for it would provide for her, while she followed it down
she walked with renewed vigour, and at nightfall reached a clearing
a way forward there was there
when the first stars climbed into the sky,
she saw low square dark shapes cutting over the horizon
she was tired, lo, but she pulled herself up
and stepped right close to the first hut she could find
a threeknock she gave, and a threewhile she waited
when the doorway opened, light spilling out,
and a tall being looking at her,
she spoke the words she was taught,
she requested kindness, and she requested rest
she spoke of being family off all that live over the land
she was welcomed and given warm blueilk
and she fell asleep softly with the empty cup still warm in her hands
when she woke it was morn, and another was observing carefully
"hello" said the other
and "hello" replied the girl
"my name is etra" said etra
"my name is watilda" she replied
and that is how watilda met etra
