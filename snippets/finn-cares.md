Because even if cannot feel them pass into the Force as clearly as you do, we
still know, and we can still choose to care. I care. They were the enemy, but
they were people, and some of them, secretly because of where they were, had
hopes and dreams, had aspirations and inspirations. And now they're dead. An
amount of life larger than I can even comprehend. I care. Therefore I weep.
