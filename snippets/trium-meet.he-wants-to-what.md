Phasma wasn't really paying attention, it was more of him and Kylo talking
infantry, until she heard what Hux was saying about the conversion of Ilum
into…

"You're building another superweapon?" she interrupted.

Hux blinked, then smiled. "Well, the first one for us, for the First Order. The
Empire was thinking too small, and built things from scratch in the middle of
space, and that's clearly ridiculous, why do that when you can just excavate."

Phasma blanks her mind and braces, and asks: "And what target…?"

"Oh, I was thinking of Hosnian Prime. As a demo."

"Ah." Her bracing almost fails, almost… but she must not, she cannot. "Very
well." and she bows down again over her datapad, affecting an uninterested air,
and carefully modulating her breath while she hears Kylo engaging Hux again in
conversation about the efficiency of the new model of blasters.

The meeting drags on a little more, and then finally breaks up and Kylo leaves
on his shuttle and Phasma walks to her transport and waves at the pilot to take
them away. She is never so grateful at the well-oiled machinery of people she
created and maintains, as she doesn't even have to _say_ or _do_ anything yet
five minutes later they're in hyperspace.

In hyperspace. Safe from Force-sensitives hearing her thoughts. Safe— and
terribly unsafe from her thoughts shouting at top volume.

_He wants to do WHAT?!_
