Rise, child, for your journey has but begun,  
rise and tell me the colour of the sky,  
rise and stand, always by me you shall be,  
I will speak, I will guide, I will ensure.

In the pale darkness of dawn,  
rise, child, today and until done.
...
Wanderer, traveler, trader, child
look me in the eye and ne'er your head dip
at the highest peak, on the tallest ship
always there, always Walk, always astride
in the pale darkness of dawn: alight, forth.
...
in the pale darkness of dawn
I look upon the fields of Rh√≤n
I wait for you, my child, my dear
Come back running through my sky.
...
in the pale darkness of dawn
I will wait for you, my child
I will wait for you forever.
