"Civil war." She sneered ever so slightly. "Why do they call it that?"

"It's not because of their manner."

"Obviously."

Kylo felt slighted, but she continued uncaring.

"Many forget that soldiers are but civilians, dressed up and trained a little.
They have family. They have emotions. Conditioning helps, as distasteful as
that is, but it doesn't erase humanity."

"We wouldn't want that," Kylo murmured.

"Indeed not." Her tone was softer. It didn't last. "Still, soldiers are
distinguished. The Republic has had its share of personnel falling from grace;
I'd rather not we gain the same reputation."

Left unmentioned was Vader, for which Kylo was grateful.

"Are you saying there is a risk?"

"There is. One of my own. Rumoured to be the bestâ€¦ but he has a conscience."

One of the FN Corps, then. Elite stormtroopers, the stuff of hero legends and
boogeymanned as warnings to disobedient children both. In the mind of anyone in
the Unknown Empire, and beyond, there was only one unit that was above them:
Kylo's own Knights of Ren. Or, as they were called when people who should have
known better thought they were safe, _Knightmares_. Nobody scared children with
tales of the Knightmares, though; who knew, they may just have come true.

"You think he'll do better with mine?"

"That, or be forgotten if he disappoints."

He nodded.

"I have an opening. Have him to me before next week, we will be gone awhile."
