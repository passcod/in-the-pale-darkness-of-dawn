The FN Corps are an elite stormtrooper unit, trained by Phasma herself before
she became Admiral. There's only one other unit that is more well-known: the
Knights of Ren. But while every stormtrooper aspires to be like the Corps,
nobody aspires to even come close to the Knights. When they think no one is
listening, stormtroopers telling stories call them the Knightmares. Children
are cowed by telling them the FN Corps might visit them if they are bad, but
they are also awed by stories of the same. Nobody scares children with tales of
the Knightmares; who knows, they might just come true.
