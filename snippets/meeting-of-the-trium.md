A masked figure was walking with purpose through brithly lit corridors, passing
many doors and two bickering janitors, before finally stepping through a
section of featureless walls ending on a sliding double door. Before entering,
or even making any movement to grant himself permission into the room beyond,
he stilled and seemed to centre himself, closing his eyes more than briefly and
breathing softly. Then he swiped his access through. [TK: check how doors are
secured in TFA ships.]

He stepped into utter darkness, at least until his eyes adjusted from the
contrast. At a five-sided table, a man and a woman sat, waiting. A single
dimmed light shone from somewhere above, casting just enough that the people
there might see their hands, if they strained. They turned towards him, and he
couldn't help but imagine the scene as they saw it: a doorway of white, with a
long shadow stretching not even halfway to them. Having been in the darkness
for Force knew how long, they probably didn't notice much in the way of
details. Just as he considered this, the door shut softly, cutting the light
source behind him.

He growled, making sure those waiting could hear him:

"Hux, would you stop with your ridiculous dramatics and turn the blasting light
up! We'll barely be able to read on flimsies."
