Paragraph near the end? Or start/middle of Part II?

Kylo never fell to the Dark. In fact, Kylo shines bright with light stronger than any before him for thousands of years. But the Force taught him to supress his shine, and to disguise himself as a user of the Dark. Kylo could never hate others, could never watch on with indifferrence as horrors were committed, but he could control his emotions and pretend, and hate himself. Sometimes he _curses_ the Force itself, and the Force soothes him, but does not let him shine out with his Light. Not yet.
