George Lucas tested the edge of the circle, recoiling as its fur sizzled and
singed. "How?" he growled at JJ Abrams.

"I saw it draw on Micheal Arndt's desk," the boy snapped. He pulled the dagger
from its sheath and held it up. "Saw this, too."

A toothy grin shined from the darkness. "Neither served him too well." Fiery
eyes shot to the bloody corpse hanging behind him. Those same eyes trailed to
his bloody paws, covered in what was left of Lawrence Kasdan. "You have brave
spirit," he said, licking at the blood. "I will celebrate your bravery by
feasting on your bones and drining your marrow. It is a fine death."

JJ Abrams weighed the golden blade in his hand. It was lighter than it looked
and it was warm to his touch. It felt like an extension of his arm. "Your mouth
isn't big enough to swallow the likes of me." He pointed the blade at George
Lucas. "But I might be able to widen it a little."
